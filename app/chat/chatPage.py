The petitioner is the State, represented by the Inspector of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau, Rajahmundry Range, Kakinada. The respondents are P. Seshagiri Rao and another individual.\n\n2. The case addresses whether the Magistrate had jurisdiction to record P. Seshagiri Rao's statement under Section 164 of the CrPC without the Investigating Agency’s request.\n\n3. P. Seshagiri Rao alleged that the Commissioner of Pithapuram Municipality demanded a bribe of Rs.1,000 to sanction a loan from his Provident Fund account. After receiving the complaint, the A.C.B. verified the antecedents, registered a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and arranged a trap where the bribe was offered, received, and seized from the Commissioner.\n\n4. P. Seshagiri Rao’s statement recorded by the Magistrate on October 30, 1999, contradicted the earlier statement made to the A.C.B. The petitioner argued that the Magistrate had no power to record statements under Section 164 without the Investigating Agency’s sponsorship, citing the Supreme Court’s decision in Jogendra Nahak.\n\n5. In Jogendra Nahak, the Supreme Court ruled that a Magistrate cannot record statements under Section 164 of the CrPC without being sponsored by the Investigating Agency, to prevent potential misuse.\n\n6. The Madras High Court’s ruling in R. Paulsamy suggested that a Magistrate’s power to record statements under Section 164 could be exercised independently of the Investigating Agency, which contrasted with the Supreme Court’s ruling.\n\n7. The court decided that the Magistrate committed an error by recording the statement without the Investigating Agency’s request. The statement was declared invalid and could not be used in the case.\n\n8. The court did not address whether the statement could be used for confronting the deponent if they testified, leaving this question open.\n\n9. The petition was granted, and the Magistrate's recording of the statement was set aside. The statement was not considered valid under Section 164 of the CrPC.",

D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The appellant, G. Yadagiri Reddy, was a Mandal Revenue Officer at the time of the alleged offense.\n\n2. The initial complaint against P.W.1 was lodged by one G. Rajender Goud, alleging that P.W.1 had encroached upon government land.\n\n3. The appellant initially demanded a bribe of ₹5,000 from P.W.1.\n\n4. The bribe amount was reduced to ₹3,000 before the trap was laid.\n\n5. The bribe money was handed over to the appellant in his office.\n\n6. The Sodium Carbonate Test was conducted to confirm the presence of bribe money on the appellant.\n\n7. The Sodium Carbonate Test results were positive, indicating that the appellant had handled the bribe money.\n\n8. After the trap was executed, ₹3,000 was recovered from the appellant’s pocket.\n\n9. P.W.1, the key prosecution witness, was the complainant who had approached the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to lodge a complaint against the appellant.\n\n10. P.W.1 responded to the bribe demand by approaching the ACB and agreeing to participate in a trap to catch the appellant red-handed.\n\n11. The appellant was convicted under Sections 7 and 13(1)(d) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.\n\n12. The trial court imposed a sentence of one year of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of ₹1,000 on the appellant.\n\n13. The primary defense raised by the appellant was that he was falsely implicated and that the bribe money was planted on him.\n\n14. The prosecution examined 8 witnesses to support its case.\n\n15. The defense examined 2 witnesses to support its claim that the appellant was falsely implicated.\n\n16. The material objects marked as evidence during the trial included the bribe money, Sodium Carbonate solution, and other items related to the trap proceedings.\n\n17. The trial court concluded that the appellant was guilty of demanding and accepting a bribe and convicted him accordingly.\n\n18. Under Section 20(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, a legal presumption is applied that once a public servant is found in possession of bribe money, it is presumed that the money was accepted as a bribe unless the contrary is proved.\n\n19. The Supreme Court cases cited by the court in its judgment included *State of Maharashtra v. Dnyaneshwar Laxman Rao Wankhede* and *B. Jayaraj v. State of Andhra Pradesh*.\n\n20. P.W.2 was the mediator who was present during the pre-trap and post-trap proceedings and witnessed the recovery of bribe money from the appellant.\n\n21. The word \"gratification\" in corruption cases, as discussed in this judgment, refers to any form of reward or consideration given to a public servant in return for performing or refraining from performing an official act.\n\n22. The court assessed the credibility of the prosecution witnesses by considering their consistency, corroboration with other evidence, and their demeanor during cross-examination.\n\n23. The court viewed the discrepancies pointed out by the defense counsel as minor and not significant enough to discredit the prosecution's case.\n\n24. The court addressed the defense's argument regarding the preparation of post-trap proceedings by noting that the procedures followed by the ACB were in line with the established norms and that no malafide intention was proved.\n\n25. The court rejected the appellant’s claim that the leftover lassi was used in the Sodium Carbonate Test by stating that the test results were consistent with the presence of bribe money, and no credible evidence was presented to support the appellant's claim.\n\n26. Once the bribe money was found in the appellant’s possession, the appellant had the burden of proving that the money was not accepted as a bribe, which he failed to do.\n\n27. The mediator's report was significant in the case as it corroborated the sequence of events during the trap and the recovery of bribe money from the appellant.\n\n28. The court interpreted the appellant’s explanation for the presence of bribe money in his pocket as unconvincing and inconsistent with the evidence presented.\n\n29. The court rejected the defense’s suggestion that the appellant was framed by noting that the appellant's explanations were implausible and not supported by any credible evidence.\n\n30. The court upheld the appellant’s conviction and sentence, finding no merit in the appeal.",

The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts.

P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The appeal is Criminal Appeal No. 1318 of 1997.\n\n2. The judgment was delivered by Dr. Justice G. Yethirajulu.\n\n3. The judgment date is 10 December 2004.\n\n4.

The appellant was convicted for demanding and accepting a bribe of Rs.500/- from P.W.1.\n\n8. The bribe amount was initially set as Rs.1,000/- but was later split into Rs.500/- to be paid before 9-3-1993 and the remaining Rs.500/- before the first week of April 1993.\n\n9. On 9-3-1993, P.W.1 paid Rs.500/- as part of the bribe, which was recovered from the appellant by ACB officials during a trap.\n\n10. The Sodium Carbonate Test on the appellant’s hands and shirt pocket was positive, confirming the presence of the tainted money.\n\n11. Key prosecution witnesses included P.W.1, P.W.3, P.W.7, and P.W.12, who testified about the bribe demand, acceptance, and recovery.\n\n12. The appellant’s defense was that P.W.1 forcibly thrust the bribe money into his pocket, which was rejected by the court.\n\n13. The court found the appellant’s defense implausible and accepted the prosecution’s evidence as credible.\n\n14. The appellant’s claim that the money was thrust into his pocket was deemed unlikely, given the circumstances and evidence.\n\n15.

The Sodium Carbonate Test confirmed that the appellant had handled the tainted money, indicating acceptance of the bribe.\n\n23. The appellant’s defense that the money was thrust into his pocket was disproved by the evidence and testimonies of witnesses.\n\n24. The appellant’s claim of not receiving a bribe was not supported by the evidence or the Sodium Carbonate Test results.\n\n25. P.W.1’s testimony and the recovered money supported the prosecution’s case, leading to the appellant’s conviction.\n\n26. The appellant’s plea of false implication due to a grudge was not accepted, as there was no substantial evidence to support it.\n\n27. The court confirmed the lower court's judgment, ruling that the prosecution had proven the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n28. The court upheld the sentences imposed by the Special Judge, finding them appropriate for the gravity of the offenses.\n\n29. The appeal was dismissed, and the Special Judge's judgment was confirmed in all respects.\n\n30.

The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15.

The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The petitioner in the case is Md. Jaffulla Khan.\n\n2.

For charges under Section 13 (1)(d)(i) and Section 13 (2), Md. Jaffulla Khan was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for two years with a fine of Rs. 2,000 for each charge.\n\n8. Accused No.2 was charged under Section 12 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, for abetment of the bribe.\n\n9. Accused No.2 was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year with a fine of Rs. 1,000.\n\n10. Accused No.1 was a Junior Assistant, and Accused No.2 was a Clerk at the time of the alleged offences.\n\n11. The primary allegation against Accused No.1 was that he demanded and received a bribe from a complainant for processing an application.\n\n12. The sanction order-Ex.P.11 was contested on the grounds that it was not legally proved. \n\n13. The argument against the sanction order included that it was introduced by the investigating officer, and there was no witness from the sanctioning authority to validate it.\n\n14. The judgment of the trial Court was pronounced on September 14, 1999.\n\n15. The defense argued that the sanction order was invalid and not properly introduced in evidence.\n\n16. The sanction order was issued under Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.\n\n17. The trial Court had convicted Accused No.1 under both Section 7 and Section 13 of the Act.\n\n18.

Muthuraman stressed on the need for proper proof of the sanction order.\n\n24. The issue of the validity of the sanction order was crucial to the appeal’s outcome.\n\n25. The appeal also argued that the evidence did not support the conviction of Accused No.2 for abetment.\n\n26. The trial Court’s reliance on statements recorded under Sections 161 and 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was questioned.\n\n27. The finding on Accused No.2’s involvement was challenged based on lack of evidence proving his knowledge of the bribe.\n\n28. The appellate court ruled that the prosecution failed to establish a valid sanction order.\n\n29. The appellate court acquitted Accused No.1 due to the invalid sanction order and set aside the trial Court’s judgment.\n\n30. The appellate court also acquitted Accused No.2, finding insufficient evidence to support the charge of abetment.",

The Court considered whether the order was arbitrary or capricious and whether it violated any constitutional rights.\n\n10.

The case highlights the tension between individual rights and administrative efficiency.\n\n17. The Court’s reasoning involved assessing the proportionality of the restriction imposed on the document writers.\n\n18. The Court recognized that while individual rights are important, they must be balanced against administrative needs.\n\n19. The ruling indicates that administrative decisions must be justified and not exceed what is necessary for their purpose.\n\n20. The case reflects the Court's approach to evaluating the reasonableness of administrative decisions affecting professional practices.\n\n21.

The Court’s decision reinforced the principle that administrative regulations should not unduly infringe on professional rights.\n\n23. The Court acknowledged the necessity for maintaining order and efficiency in public offices.\n\n24. The judgment reaffirmed the principle that professional rights can be regulated in the interest of effective governance.\n\n25.

The respondents in this case are the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, represented by the Secretary, Department of Personnel and Administration Reforms, North Block, New Delhi, and others.\n3. The main issue in the case is whether the petitioner is entitled to an extension of the time limit to avail of the Traveling Allowance (TA) after his retirement.\n4. The petitioner’s position at the time of his retirement was Deputy Director.\n5. The petitioner retired from his position on 31st July 1997.\n6. The petitioner is seeking the benefit of Traveling Allowance (TA) to settle down in his hometown after retirement.\n7. The general rule is that the Traveling Allowance (TA) can be availed of at any time during Leave Preparatory to Retirement (LPR) or within one year of the date of retirement.\n8. The time limit for availing TA can be extended in special cases by the Administrative Ministries/Departments concerned under SR 147 of the Government of India.\n9. The petitioner sought an extension of the time limit for TA because his General Provident Fund (GPF) account had not been settled at the time of his retirement.\n10. The authorities responded to the petitioner’s request by stating that the non-settlement of the GPF was not a sufficient reason for the extension of the time limit for TA.\n11. The Central Administrative Tribunal dismissed the petitioner’s application by an order dated 18th February 2000.\n12. A banker's cheque for Rs. 12,750/- was given to the petitioner as part of the final settlement of his General Provident Fund (GPF).\n13. The petitioner contends that the respondents did not properly consider sub-rule (4) of Rule 11 of the General Provident Fund (Central Services) Rules.\n14. Rule 34 of the General Provident Fund (Central Services) Rules pertains to the manner of payment of the amount in the fund to the subscriber or his beneficiaries.\n15. Rule 35 of the General Provident Fund (Central Services) Rules pertains to the conditions of subscription to the GPF, including the circumstances under which a subscriber may choose not to subscribe during leave.\n16. The petitioner contended that the amount of interest on his GPF had not been properly calculated and only a portion of the interest was paid after filing the writ application.\n17. The respondents did not provide clear details on how the interest on the petitioner’s GPF was calculated from 1973 to June 2000.\n18. The role of the Accounts Officer as per Rule 34 is to ensure the payment of the amount standing to the credit of the subscriber in the GPF when it becomes payable, including issuing payment authority and verifying the ledger account.\n19. The date 7th September 1999 is significant because it was when the respondents informed the petitioner that the non-settlement of his GPF was not a sufficient reason to extend the time limit for TA.\n20. The petitioner claimed that there was no evidence to support the tribunal’s assumption that he did not want to leave Hyderabad because his wife was employed there.\n21. The court opined that the authorities’ discretion in extending the time limit for TA should have been exercised reasonably, taking into consideration the relevant factors and the law.\n22. Discretion should be exercised reasonably, not capriciously, and should be guided by law. It must not be arbitrary, vague, or fanciful, and should involve good faith in discharging public duty.\n23. The court viewed the tribunal’s rejection of the petitioner’s contention as based on an unsupported assumption, and it lacked proper consideration of the relevant facts.\n24. The doctrine of self-restraint refers to the court's decision to allow the statutory authority to pass an appropriate order at the first instance rather than exercising the same power itself.\n25. The court directed the respondents to reconsider the matter afresh and pass an appropriate order within two weeks from the date of communication of the order.\n26. The court decided not to exercise the power itself in this case due to the doctrine of self-restraint, allowing the statutory authority to act first.\n27. The court noted that the petitioner’s representations were not disposed of expeditiously, and no explanation was provided for the delay.\n28. The petitioner’s representations and reminders are significant because they highlight the lack of timely response from the authorities, which contributed to the delay in settling his GPF.\n29. The court emphasized the importance of good faith in discharging public duty, implying that the authorities must act within the scope of the law and avoid arbitrary decisions.\n30. The final direction given by the court to the respondents was to reconsider the petitioner’s request for TA in light of all relevant factors and pass an appropriate order within two weeks.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The appellant is Dr. Navarathan Singh.\n\n2. The respondent is the State of Andhra Pradesh, represented by its D.S.P., ACB, Nizamabad Range, Nizamabad.\n\n3. The case is a criminal appeal against the judgment in C.C.No.11 of 1998 from the Principal Special Judge for SPE & ACB Cases, Hyderabad.\n\n4. The appellant was charged under Sections 7 and 13(1)(d) read with 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.\n\n5. The allegation was that the appellant demanded and accepted Rs.750 as a bribe for providing proper medical treatment to the complainant's daughter.\n\n6. The trial court found the appellant guilty and sentenced him to one year of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.500 under each section. The sentences were to run concurrently.\n\n7. The appellant was working as a Medical Officer at the Community Health Centre, Bodhan, Nizamabad District at the time of the alleged offense.\n\n8. The complainant was a resident of Rudrur, Nizamabad District, whose pregnant daughter was admitted to the hospital where the appellant worked.\n\n9. The complainant's daughter was admitted to the hospital on February 12, 1997, and the appellant, after examining her, demanded a bribe for performing an operation.\n\n10. The complainant managed to pay Rs.1,500 out of the demanded Rs.2,250 by mortgaging and selling jewelry.\n\n11. The appellant allegedly harassed the complainant for the remaining Rs.750.\n\n12. The complainant approached the D.S.P., A.C.B., and lodged a complaint on February 25, 1997.\n\n13. A trap was laid by the A.C.B. on February 26, 1997, where the appellant was caught accepting the bribe.\n\n14. The prosecution presented nine witnesses (PWs) and marked exhibits and material objects to support its case.\n\n15. PW-1, the complainant, turned hostile and did not support the prosecution's case.\n\n16. PW-2, the accompanying witness during the trap, testified that the appellant accepted the money and kept it under a pen stand.\n\n17. PW-3, a jeweler, testified that the complainant had sold jewelry to raise money to pay the appellant.\n\n18. PW-4, the landlord of the appellant’s clinic, did not provide any significant evidence.\n\n19. PW-5, a Deputy Civil Surgeon, confirmed that the complainant’s daughter was treated at the hospital by the appellant.\n\n20. PW-6, a Judicial Magistrate, recorded the complainant’s statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C.\n\n21. PW-7 testified about the sanction order for the prosecution of the appellant.\n\n22. PW-8 testified that the complainant had informed him about the appellant’s demand for a bribe, and he assisted her in drafting the complaint.\n\n23. PW-9, the D.S.P., detailed the procedures of the trap and the subsequent investigation.\n\n24. The appellant's defense was that the money was given for the treatment of the complainant's nephew, not as a bribe.\n\n25. The lower court found the appellant guilty, relying heavily on the testimony of PW-2 and other circumstantial evidence.\n\n26. The appellant argued that the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the money was demanded as a bribe.\n\n27. The prosecution's case was weakened by the failure to prove the demand for a bribe and the absence of direct evidence linking the payment to any illegal favor.\n\n28. The judgment was criticized for shifting the burden of proof to the appellant instead of requiring the prosecution to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n29. The court noted inconsistencies in the prosecution’s case, such as the lack of proof that the money was paid in the government hospital and not in the private clinic.\n\n30. The appeal was allowed, and the appellant was given the benefit of the doubt, leading to the setting aside of the conviction and sentence.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The Writ Appeal number is 1747 of 1999, and the date of the case is 18 April 2002.\n   \n2. The appeal was presided over by THE HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE S.R. NAYAK.\n\n3. The petitioner is V. Anjaneya Sarma, and the respondents are the Industrial Tribunal and another (presumably Bank of Baroda).\n\n4. The counsel for the appellant was M/s. V. Venkataramana, and the counsel for the respondents were Mr. T. Viswanadha Sastry and the Government Pleader for Labour.\n\n5. The appellant was challenging the correctness of the order passed by the learned single Judge on 22-9-1999 in W.P.No.12655 of 1994, which dismissed the appellant's writ petition seeking to quash the Industrial Tribunal's award dated 29-10-1993.\n\n6. The petitioner was a Shroff-cum-Godown Keeper in Bank of Baroda, later re-designated as Cashier.\n\n7. The petitioner was alleged to have issued four cheques amounting to Rs. 4500 drawn on his savings account and obstructed their normal process by purloining them, thereby preventing their clearance.\n\n8. The petitioner was dismissed from service following an enquiry that held the charges of misconduct proved.\n\n9. The bank issued a charge sheet against the petitioner, conducted an enquiry, and subsequently dismissed the petitioner from service on 17-7-1985.\n\n10. The departmental appeal was rejected on 7-11-1985.\n\n11. The petitioner raised an industrial dispute (I.D.No.65 of 1987) before the Industrial Tribunal, challenging the validity of the disciplinary proceedings and the appellate order.\n\n12. The Industrial Tribunal upheld the validity of the disciplinary proceedings and the penalty of dismissal from service in its award dated 17-10-1988.\n\n13. The High Court, in W.P.No.3910 of 1989, remanded the matter back to the Industrial Tribunal for reconsideration under Section 11A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.\n\n14. After remand, the Industrial Tribunal again dismissed the industrial dispute (I.D.) by an award dated 29-10-1993.\n\n15. The petitioner challenged the award on grounds that the penalty was disproportionate to the gravity of the charges, his service record was blemishless, and that no financial loss was caused to the bank.\n\n16. The counsel argued that the penalty of dismissal was excessive, violated Article 21 of the Constitution, and that the Industrial Tribunal failed to exercise discretion judiciously after the case was remanded.\n\n17. The Management argued that the penalty was justified given the gravity of the misconduct and that the Industrial Tribunal had properly exercised its discretion.\n\n18. The learned single Judge concluded that the Industrial Tribunal had properly exercised the discretionary power vested in it under Section 11A of the Act and found the penalty appropriate.\n\n19. The appellant's counsel argued that the Industrial Tribunal did not judiciously exercise its discretion after the remand and was unduly influenced by the findings of the appellate authority.\n\n20. The learned standing counsel for Bank of Baroda supported the award passed by the Industrial Tribunal and the judgment of the learned single Judge.\n\n21. The High Court found no merit in the contentions of the appellant and dismissed the appeal.\n\n22. The Industrial Tribunal justified the penalty based on a reappraisal of the entire evidence, finding it proportionate to the gravity of the misconduct.\n\n23. The appellate authority stated that the misconduct was grave, posed a potential danger to colleagues, and warranted deterrent punishment, not less than dismissal.\n\n24. In the case of \"Tarachand Vyas v. Chairman & Disciplinary,\" the Supreme Court emphasized the duties of bank employees to uphold integrity, probity, and the public trust placed in them.\n\n25. An employer expects loyalty and honest service from an employee, which is implied in every contract of employment.\n\n26. Misconduct justifying dismissal occurs when an employee acts in a way inconsistent with the faithful discharge of duties, even if the act is outside of direct service responsibilities.\n\n27. Lord Esher observed that a servant could be dismissed if their conduct, even outside of service, makes it unsafe for the master to continue the employment.\n\n28. The case emphasized the importance of bank employees adhering strictly to a code of conduct, given their role as trustees of public funds.\n\n29. The High Court may interfere with Industrial Court orders only if the exercise of discretion under Section 11A is perverse or irrational.\n\n30. The Supreme Court held that a penalty based on proved misconduct cannot be substituted by a court unless it is shockingly disproportionate or mala fide.",

The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. Writ Petition Nos.24404 of 2002 and 24979 of 2002 are involved in this case.\n2. The judgment was delivered on 11 March 2005.\n3. The case was presided over by The Hon'ble Mr. Justice G. Bikshapathy and The Hon'ble Mr. Justice P.S. Narayana.\n4. The petitioners in Writ Petition No. 24404 of 2002 are Union of India, Rep. by Joint Director, Establishment (D&A), Rail Bhavan Railway Board, New Delhi, and Divisional Railway Manager South Central Railway, Vijayawada.\n5. The respondent in Writ Petition No. 24404 of 2002 is Shaik Mahaboob Sahab.\n6. The petitioner in Writ Petition No. 24979 of 2002 is Shaik Mahaboob Sahab.\n7. The respondents in Writ Petition No. 24979 of 2002 are Union of India, Rep. by Joint Director, Establishment (D&A), Rail Bhavan Railway Board, New Delhi, and Divisional Railway Manager South Central Railway, Vijayawada.\n8. The counsel for the petitioners was Mr. R.S. Murthy.\n9. The counsel for the respondents was Mr. A. Hanumantha Reddy.\n10. The original disciplinary action taken against Shaik Mahaboob Sahab in 1982 was a punishment of reduction in rank to the post of peon for a period of four years.\n11. Shaik Mahaboob Sahab’s appeal against the initial disciplinary action in 1983 resulted in enhancement of the punishment to removal from service.\n12. The Supreme Court of India remanded the matter back for reconsideration in 1990.\n13. The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) decided on 01.05.1991 to set aside the punishment imposed on the applicant but allowed the Railways to continue the disciplinary enquiry.\n14. From 17.10.1983 to 31.05.1990, Shaik Mahaboob Sahab was kept under deemed suspension by the Railways.\n15. The enquiry officer was appointed to conduct the disciplinary enquiry against Shaik Mahaboob Sahab on 25.09.1995.\n16. Shaik Mahaboob Sahab filed O.A.No.1031 of 1998 to quash the charge memo issued on 16.12.2000.\n17. The Tribunal ordered on 24.11.1998 that the respondents pay DCRG to Shaik Mahaboob Sahab within two weeks and dispose of the enquiry not later than 31.01.1999.\n18. The Writ Petition numbers filed against the Tribunal’s order on 24.11.1998 were W.P.No.3506 of 1999 and W.P.No.5588 of 2000.\n19. The outcome of W.P.No.3506 of 1999 filed by the railway administration was that it was dismissed.\n20. The final decision of the Tribunal on 31.12.2001 regarding Shaik Mahaboob Sahab’s pension was to withhold the entire monthly pension on a permanent basis.\n21. The Tribunal ordered that 50% of Shaik Mahaboob Sahab’s monthly pension be withheld permanently.\n22. The Tribunal referred to the cases of Wasdev Singh v. State of Punjab & Haryana High Court, Dinesh Chandra Sarkar v. State of West Bengal & Ors., and State of Maharashtra v. M.H. Mazumdar.\n23. The Punjab & Haryana High Court ruled in the case of Wasdev Singh v. State of Punjab & Haryana High Court that having allowed the petitioner to retire, it is not open to the Government to order a cut in the pension on the ground of misconduct unless there is a pecuniary loss to the Government.\n24. The High Court of Calcutta decided in the case of Dinesh Chandra Sarkar v. State of West Bengal & Ors. that there cannot be any continuation of disciplinary proceedings unless there is a pecuniary loss.\n25. The decision of the Supreme Court in the case of State of Maharashtra v. M.H. Mazumdar was that reduction of pension by 50% was disproportionate to the charges, and the State Government was directed to reconsider the reduction.\n26. The Tribunal considered the fact that there was no pecuniary loss to the Government when deciding not to withhold the entire pension of Shaik Mahaboob Sahab.\n27. The Union of India’s argument against the Tribunal’s order was that the charge of corruption is a grave one, and the Tribunal erred in directing the payment of 50% of the pension.\n28. Shaik Mahaboob Sahab’s counsel cited the case STATE OF U.P. AND OTHERS v. Jawhar Lal Bhatia in support of their argument against the withholding of the pension.\n29. The court differentiated the current case from the one cited by the Apex Court in STATE OF U.P. AND OTHERS v. Jawhar Lal Bhatia by noting that the current case involved a charge of corruption, making it distinguishable.\n30. The final ruling of the High Court on the two Writ Petitions was that both Writ Petitions were dismissed.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21.

The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The primary issue in writ petition No. 14209 of 2003 was the alleged inaction of the police in executing a non-bailable warrant (N.B.W) against the third respondent, which led to a delay in the prosecution of the case.\n\n2. The petitioner in this case was Jayalaxmi Traders.\n\n3. The third respondent was convicted under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and sentenced to imprisonment, as well as directed to pay a fine. The High Court had also ordered proceedings under Section 420 of IPC.\n\n4. The criminal charges against the third respondent were related to the dishonor of cheques issued to Jayalaxmi Traders, amounting to a significant sum.\n\n5. The amount involved in the dispute between Jayalaxmi Traders and M/s.Vikas Trading Corporation was Rs. 4,87,000/-.\n\n6. The cheques issued by the third respondent were dishonoured due to insufficient funds in the account.\n\n7. After the cheques were dishonoured, Jayalaxmi Traders filed a complaint against the third respondent, leading to the criminal case and subsequent conviction.\n\n8. In the initial criminal case, the trial court convicted the third respondent under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, and further proceedings under Section 420 of IPC were ordered.\n\n9. The High Court directed that the proceedings under Section 420 of IPC should continue to ensure that justice was served.\n\n10. The petitioner alleged that the third respondent's arrest warrant had not been executed despite several attempts.\n\n11. The petitioner claimed that the police did not execute the N.B.W due to negligence and inaction, which caused unnecessary delays.\n\n12. According to the counter affidavit filed by the Superintendent of Police, the police took several steps to locate the third respondent, including conducting searches and inquiring about his whereabouts.\n\n13. The affidavit filed by the Director General and Inspector General of Police revealed that the police had made attempts to execute the warrant but faced difficulties due to the third respondent's attempts to evade arrest.\n\n14. The Director General of Police’s affidavit revealed that there were delays in executing the warrants due to procedural issues and the third respondent's attempts to avoid arrest.\n\n15. The Court responded to the petitioner's request to withdraw the writ petition by acknowledging the seriousness of the case and continuing to monitor the situation.\n\n16. The Division Bench of the High Court decided to continue the writ appeal filed by the petitioner to ensure that the police took appropriate action.\n\n17. The Director General of Police’s affidavit attributed the delay in executing the N.B.W to procedural inefficiencies and difficulties in locating the third respondent.\n\n18. The Court viewed the delay and inaction of the police as unacceptable and emphasized the need for timely execution of legal orders.\n\n19. The Supreme Court judgments cited in the article emphasized that criminal law should be applied rigorously to ensure justice and that delays in legal proceedings undermine the rule of law.\n\n20. The special team headed by the Inspector of Police made several efforts to apprehend the third respondent, including conducting searches and gathering information.\n\n21. The special team’s efforts to locate the third respondent were met with some success, but the third respondent continued to evade arrest.\n\n22. The third respondent’s parents attempted to resolve the issue by negotiating with Jayalaxmi Traders and offering to settle the amount due.\n\n23. The Court’s stance on the use of public law remedies was that they should be used to address serious issues of justice, especially when other legal avenues are ineffective.\n\n24. The constitutional principle highlighted in the judgment was the rule of law, emphasizing that all individuals are subject to the law and must be held accountable for their actions.\n\n25. The significance of the telegram received on 26.12.2004 was that it indicated the third respondent's continued attempts to evade arrest and avoid legal consequences.\n\n26. The Court ensured that justice was served by continuing to monitor the case and pressuring the police to execute the warrant and apprehend the third respondent.\n\n27. The role of the Advocate General in this case was to provide legal advice and ensure that the legal proceedings were conducted appropriately.\n\n28. The Court took measures to monitor the police’s efforts in executing the warrant by requiring regular updates and progress reports.\n\n29. The Court addressed the issue of the third respondent’s political and financial influence by emphasizing that no one is above the law and that justice should be served impartially.\n\n30. The final outcome of the case was that the Court continued to press for the execution of the non-bailable warrant and ensured that the police took the necessary steps to apprehend the third respondent.",

The writ petition challenges the legality and validity of G.O. Ms. No. 429, which dismissed the petitioner from service with immediate effect.\n3. G.O. Ms. No. 429 was issued by the Home (Courts-C) Department of the Government of Andhra Pradesh.\n4. At the time of the alleged misconduct, the petitioner was a Munsif-Magistrate at Bhainsa.\n5. The departmental enquiry began following a complaint from the Bar Association, Bhainsa, leading to a suo motu enquiry by the District and Sessions Judge, Adilabad.\n6. The District and Sessions Judge, Nizamabad, conducted a regular enquiry against the petitioner based on the initial report and complaint.\n7. The Enquiry Officer framed three charges against the petitioner, examining eight witnesses and marking 21 documents.\n8. The Enquiry Officer’s report concluded that the first charge was proved while charges two and three were not.\n9. The High Court issued a show cause notice to the petitioner on 28-8-1992 regarding the findings of the Enquiry Officer and potential dismissal.\n10. The petitioner’s explanation to the show cause notice was submitted on 1-10-1992.\n11. The High Court recommended dismissal based on the findings, which the Government of Andhra Pradesh accepted.\n12. The Government of Andhra Pradesh issued G.O. Ms. No. 429 on 7-10-1993, dismissing the petitioner from service.\n13. The counter-affidavit by the High Court stated that the enquiry was conducted under Article 235 of the Constitution and adhered to the A.P. Civil Services Rules.\n14. Charge No. 1 alleged that the petitioner demanded and received a bribe of Rs. 10,000 for granting bail.\n15. The evidence against the petitioner included witness statements and documents reviewed by the Enquiry Officer.\n16. The petitioner argued that witness evidence was inconsistent and that the enquiry was biased due to disputes with Bar Association members.\n17. The court found the evidence of P.W.1 to P.W.6 credible and consistent, particularly P.W.6, who was a key witness.\n18. The court noted that the standard for disciplinary proceedings is different from criminal trials, focusing on preponderance of probabilities rather than proof beyond reasonable doubt.\n19. Judicial review does not extend to re-appraising evidence but ensuring fair conduct of the enquiry and adherence to legal principles.\n20. The court referenced the Supreme Court’s judgment in **High Court of Judicature at Bombay vs. Shashikant S. Patil** regarding the scope of judicial interference in disciplinary matters.\n21. The court also cited **B.C. Chaturvedi vs. Union of India** to emphasize that judicial review focuses on the conduct of the enquiry rather than the correctness of the conclusions.\n22. The court concluded that the petitioner’s misconduct was proven based on the evidence presented.\n23. The court justified the dismissal based on the importance of maintaining discipline and integrity within the judicial service.\n24. The petitioner’s claim of evidence discrepancies and bias did not convince the court to overturn the decision.\n25.

The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The case citation is [2006] INAPHC 594 (19 October 2006).\n2. The judgment was delivered on October 19, 2006.\n3. The presiding judge was The Hon'ble Sri Justice Gopalakrishna Tamada.\n4. The Criminal Appeal number is No. 1416 of 2001.\n5. Vidadala Maruthi Hari Prasad Rao was the decoy in the case.\n6. The original complaint was filed by the Special Judge for SPE & ACB Cases, Vijayawada.\n7. The appellant was charged under Section 193 of the IPC.\n8. The main allegation was giving false evidence contrary to his earlier statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C.\n9. The original court handling the case was the Special Judge for SPE & ACB Cases, Vijayawada.\n10. Section 193 of the IPC deals with the punishment for giving false evidence.\n11. The appellant’s senior counsel, Mr. T. Balreddy, argued the complaint was filed without holding an inquiry under Section 340 of Cr.P.C.\n12. The respondent’s counsel, Mr. V. Ravi Kiran Rao, argued that the inquiry under Section 340 of Cr.P.C. is not mandatory.\n13. Section 340 of Cr.P.C. deals with the procedure in cases where an offense affecting the administration of justice has been committed.\n14. The appellant was accused of giving false evidence by deviating from his earlier statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C.\n15. The accused-officer in C.C.No.11 of 1996 was acquitted in the original trial.\n16. The appellant’s Section 164 Cr.P.C. statement (Ex.P6) was significant in establishing the accused-officer's demand and acceptance of a bribe.\n17. The appellant's testimony in court differed from his Section 164 statement possibly due to the lapse of time, not deliberate falsehood.\n18. Approximately four years elapsed between the recording of the appellant's Section 164 Cr.P.C. statement and his court testimony.\n19. The Special Judge concluded that the appellant had committed an offense under Section 193 IPC by giving false evidence.\n20. A court may make a complaint under Section 340 Cr.P.C. when it is expedient in the interest of justice.\n21. It is not mandatory for a court to hold a preliminary inquiry before filing a complaint under Section 340 Cr.P.C.\n22. The court emphasized that prosecution for perjury should not be initiated too readily or frequently; it should only be initiated when perjury is deliberate and conscious.\n23. The court noted that there was a deviation in the appellant's statement but that it did not necessarily imply deliberate falsehood.\n24. The long lapse of time (over 11 years since the date of the offense) was considered a factor against the expediency of prosecution for perjury.\n25. The court set aside the complaint made by the Special Judge for SPE and ACB Cases and allowed the criminal appeal.\n26. The appellant’s counsel argued that the Special Judge had prejudged the issue by making observations about the appellant's guilt.\n27. The appellant was examined as P.W.1 in C.C.No.11 of 1996.\n28. The original case involved a trap arranged by the appellant where Kethavath Kasana Naik was accused of accepting a bribe.\n29. The bribe involved was Rs.200, which the accused-officer allegedly demanded and accepted.\n30. The appellant’s deviation from his earlier statement was a key factor leading to the accused-officer’s acquittal in C.C.No.11 of 1996.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The petitioner was designated as a Junior Engineer (Electrical) working at the Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board (APSEB) at the time of his transfer.\n\n2. The petitioner was transferred to the Lower Sileru Project on 16-6-1993.\n\n3. In response to the transfer order, the petitioner submitted a representation stating that he should not be transferred because of his family circumstances.\n\n4. After his representation was considered, the petitioner was posted back to his previous station at Jangaon.\n\n5. The main reason cited in the charge sheet issued to the petitioner on 18-10-1993 was that he had not submitted his immovable property statements for the years 1991-92 and 1992-93.\n\n6. The petitioner submitted his explanation to the charge sheet on 24-10-1993.\n\n7. After finding the petitioner’s explanation unsatisfactory, the authorities issued a show cause notice on 29-4-1994.\n\n8. The show cause notice included the findings of an Anti-Corruption Bureau enquiry and the non-submission of immovable property statements as grounds for disciplinary action.\n\n9. The petitioner’s counsel argued that the inclusion of the Anti-Corruption Bureau's enquiry in the show cause notice was improper and not mentioned in the original charge sheet.\n\n10. The petitioner argued that the punishment for non-submission of immovable property statements was disproportionate and that it should not have been included as a ground for major penalty.\n\n11. The respondents argued that the writ petition should be dismissed on grounds that alternative remedies were available and that the procedural requirements were met for the imposition of penalties.\n\n12. The respondents justified the mention of non-submission of property statements in the show cause notice by stating that it was part of the overall disciplinary action.\n\n13. The contention was that the stoppage of increments with cumulative effect was a major penalty, which required a full departmental enquiry.\n\n14. The court viewed the existence of an alternative remedy as not sufficient to preclude the filing of a writ petition in this case, especially given the nature of the allegations.\n\n15. Exceptions to the rule of exhausting alternative remedies include cases involving fundamental rights or issues of significant public interest.\n\n16. The court addressed the issue of alternative remedies by finding that the petitioner’s case fell within the exceptions where a writ petition could be entertained.\n\n17. The significance of the specific language used in the impugned order was that it indicated a major penalty was being imposed without proper procedural adherence.\n\n18. The court found that the procedural requirement of holding a departmental enquiry before imposing a major penalty was not met in the impugned order.\n\n19. The Supreme Court and this Court's previous judgments indicated that the stoppage of increments with cumulative effect is considered a major penalty and requires a formal departmental enquiry.\n\n20. Regulation 5 of the APSEB (Revised) Conduct Regulations categorized penalties into minor penalties and major penalties.\n\n21. Regulation 5(iii) refers to minor penalties, while Regulation 5(iv) refers to major penalties such as stoppage of increments with cumulative effect.\n\n22. The court found that the stoppage of increments with cumulative effect was indeed a major penalty and required adherence to the procedure for major penalties.\n\n23. The court interpreted the need for a departmental enquiry as essential for imposing major penalties, ensuring fairness and proper procedural conduct.\n\n24. The court noted that imposing punishment solely based on unauthorized absence, without a proper enquiry, was not permissible.\n\n25. The final decision was to set aside the part of the impugned order related to the stoppage of increments with cumulative effect, as it was imposed without proper procedure.\n\n26. The court directed the disciplinary authority to proceed with a proper departmental enquiry and to reconsider the disciplinary action in accordance with the procedure.\n\n27. The court suggested that disciplinary action for non-submission of immovable property statements could be initiated, but must follow the appropriate procedural requirements.\n\n28. The nature of the punishment imposed was the stoppage of increments with cumulative effect, which was later deemed improper due to procedural violations.\n\n29. For imposing major penalties under Regulation 10(2)(a), a full departmental enquiry must be conducted, following due process and providing the employee with an opportunity to defend themselves.\n\n30. The court reconciled the facts of the case with the procedural requirements by determining that proper procedures for imposing major penalties were not followed and directed adherence to these procedures.",

The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. Petitioners may be entitled to a Writ of Mandamus if they can demonstrate that the police have a clear legal duty to act and have failed to do so. The Supreme Court has held that if police officers refuse to register an FIR despite having a cognizable offence, a writ may be issued to compel them to fulfill their duties.\n\n2. Yes, petitioners can approach the Magistrate under Sections 190 and 200 of the CrPC, which allows them to file a private complaint if the police refuse to act. They can also escalate the matter to higher police authorities or the state police chief.\n\n3. Section 154 mandates police officers to register an FIR for cognizable offences. Section 157 requires the police to investigate the case and report findings to the Magistrate. Failure to comply with these provisions can lead to legal consequences.\n\n4. The individual can file a complaint before a Magistrate under Section 200 of the CrPC. They can also approach higher police authorities or file a writ petition in the High Court if other remedies are exhausted.\n\n5. Under Section 190, a Magistrate can take cognizance of a complaint and direct an investigation. Section 200 allows a Magistrate to examine the complainant and witnesses. Section 210 deals with cases where the police report is incomplete or not acted upon by the Magistrate.\n\n6. These judgments emphasize the police's duty to register an FIR for cognizable offences and outline circumstances under which a writ can be issued to compel police action. They reinforce the principle that a legal remedy should be sought when police fail to fulfill their duties.\n\n7. A writ petition is appropriate when other remedies are ineffective or exhausted. It is used to compel authorities to perform their legal duties, especially when there is no effective alternative remedy available.\n\n8. The Supreme Court has clarified that a writ of Mandamus can be issued to the police if they fail to act upon a cognizable offence and there is no effective remedy available through other legal channels.\n\n9. The High Court's judgment may be challenged in the Supreme Court if it is believed that the High Court erred in its interpretation of the law or facts of the case.\n\n10. The decision of the Supreme Court is binding on all lower courts and authorities, including the police, which means that they are required to follow the Supreme Court's directives.\n\n11. The Court's power to issue a Writ of Mandamus is derived from Article 226 of the Constitution, which allows High Courts to enforce fundamental rights and other legal rights.\n\n12. The petitioners need to establish that the police's failure to act is a violation of their legal duty and that no other effective remedy is available to them.\n\n13. The police may be directed to investigate the complaint and take appropriate action if it is found that they have failed to perform their statutory duties.\n\n14. The legal principle established is that a writ of Mandamus is a remedy available when there is a clear legal duty to act and a failure to do so, provided no other effective remedy is available.\n\n15. The Supreme Court's decisions in similar cases are relevant as they set precedents on the circumstances under which a writ of Mandamus can be issued to compel police action.\n\n16. The petitioners' ability to seek a writ is contingent on proving that the police's inaction is contrary to their legal obligations and that no alternative legal remedies have been effective.\n\n17. The Court may review the factual accuracy and legal interpretation of the case, especially if it involves a fundamental right or significant legal principle.\n\n18. The High Court is expected to follow the legal standards established by the Supreme Court and other relevant legal precedents in determining the appropriateness of issuing a writ.\n\n19. The petitioners' arguments should address the specific legal duty of the police and demonstrate how their inaction constitutes a breach of that duty.\n\n20. The Supreme Court's guidance on the issuance of writs of Mandamus is significant for ensuring that lower courts and authorities adhere to established legal standards.\n\n21. The Court's decision on the petitioners' request will consider whether the police have indeed failed to perform their statutory duties and whether the petitioners have exhausted other remedies.\n\n22. The petitioners must show that their fundamental rights or legal rights have been violated due to the police's failure to act.\n\n23. If the police's failure to register an FIR or investigate is found to be a clear breach of duty, the Court may issue a writ directing them to perform their statutory obligations.\n\n24. The High Court's role is to ensure that legal duties are performed and that petitioners have access to justice when other remedies are insufficient.\n\n25. The Court's review will include an examination of whether the petitioners have met the criteria for issuing a writ of Mandamus, including the existence of a clear legal duty and failure to act.\n\n26. The Supreme Court's precedents guide the High Court in determining the appropriate relief and ensuring that legal obligations are enforced.\n\n27. The Court may consider whether the petitioners' grievances are justified and whether the police's inaction has led to a denial of legal rights.\n\n28. The petitioners must demonstrate that they have sought other remedies and that the writ of Mandamus is necessary to address their grievances.\n\n29. The High Court's decision will be influenced by the legal principles governing the issuance of writs and the specific facts of the case.\n\n30. The Supreme Court's directives are binding, and lower courts and authorities are expected to comply with them, ensuring that legal duties are fulfilled and justice is served.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The main issue was whether the disciplinary authority was correct in treating the period of suspension as ‘not on duty’ and denying the petitioner full wages for that period while imposing a minor penalty of censure.\n\n2. The petitioner was seeking a certiorari to quash the orders treating the suspension period as ‘not on duty’ and denying full wages, claiming they were arbitrary and illegal.\n\n3. The respondents were the Executive Committee of the Central Warehousing Corporation and another unnamed respondent.\n\n4. The penalty imposed on the petitioner was a minor penalty of censure.\n\n5. The petitioner challenged the orders on the grounds that the disciplinary authority had no authority to treat the period of suspension as ‘not on duty’ and deny full wages, especially for a minor penalty like censure.\n\n6. The petitioner argued that the period of suspension should be treated as ‘on duty’ for all purposes, including full wages, seniority, and promotion, and that the suspension was unwarranted for minor misconduct.\n\n7. The respondents justified it by stating that the Circulars from the Central Government regarding suspension for minor penalties were not adopted by the respondent-Corporation, and the disciplinary authority had the discretion to determine how to treat the suspension period.\n\n8. The petitioner argued that the writ petition was maintainable because parts of the cause of action arose within the territorial jurisdiction of the court, specifically where the orders were communicated to him.\n\n9. The court held that the writ petition was maintainable because the orders affecting the petitioner were communicated while he was working within the court's jurisdiction, thus part of the cause of action arose within that jurisdiction.\n\n10. The respondents asserted that the Central Government Circulars cited by the petitioner were not relevant as they were not adopted by the respondent-Corporation.\n\n11. The court interpreted \"cause of action\" to include the effect of the order on the petitioner when it was communicated to him within the court’s jurisdiction, thus allowing the court to entertain the petition.\n\n12. The court agreed that the disciplinary authority had the power to suspend the petitioner but questioned the reasonableness of treating the suspension period as ‘not on duty’ while imposing a minor penalty of censure.\n\n13. The court stated that while the disciplinary authority had the power to impose penalties, treating the suspension period as ‘not on duty’ for a minor penalty like censure was unreasonable and against good conscience.\n\n14. The court distinguished that while censure was a minor penalty, treating the suspension period as ‘not on duty’ was akin to a major punishment, which was disproportionate to the minor penalty imposed.\n\n15. The court decided that the period of suspension should be treated as ‘on duty’ for all purposes, including increments, seniority, and promotion, but upheld the denial of full salary payment beyond the subsistence allowance.\n\n16. Yes, the court upheld the denial of payment beyond the subsistence allowance, affirming that the petitioner was only entitled to the subsistence allowance during the suspension period.\n\n17. The court relied on the principle that an order only takes effect upon communication to the concerned employee, and therefore, the cause of action can arise where the order is communicated.\n\n18. The court found that treating the suspension period as ‘not on duty’ while imposing a minor penalty was unreasonable and violated principles of fairness, leading to the adjustment of the suspension period to ‘on duty.’\n\n19. The court ruled that treating the suspension period as ‘on duty’ should ensure that the petitioner’s seniority, promotion, and other benefits are not adversely affected.\n\n20. The judgments cited by the petitioner emphasized that part of the cause of action arises where the effect of the order is felt, supporting the court’s jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\n21. The court interpreted \"cause of action\" broadly to include the location where the effect of the impugned order is felt, thus supporting the court's jurisdiction over service matters impacting employees within its territory.\n\n22. The court viewed it as unreasonable and disproportionate, stating that such treatment effectively amounted to a major punishment, contrary to the minor nature of the censure penalty.\n\n23. The court’s decision reflected administrative fairness by ensuring that the minor penalty of censure did not result in severe consequences like the denial of benefits due to suspension, thus upholding reasonableness.\n\n24. The court did not explicitly agree with the claim but focused on the unreasonable treatment of the suspension period rather than the necessity of the suspension itself.\n\n25. The appellate authority reviewed and rejected the petitioner’s appeal against the disciplinary authority’s orders, thereby confirming the treatment of the suspension period as ‘not on duty.’\n\n26. The court addressed it by affirming that the cause of action included where the orders were communicated and had effect, which was within its jurisdiction.\n\n27. The final ruling was that the petitioner was entitled to have the suspension period treated as ‘on duty’ for purposes like increments and seniority but not entitled to wages beyond the subsistence allowance.\n\n28. The court handled it by focusing on the reasonableness of the treatment of the suspension period rather than the excessiveness of the disciplinary action itself.\n\n29. The implications were that the suspension period would count as service for purposes of increments, seniority, and promotion, but the petitioner would not receive full salary payment during the suspension period.\n\n30. The ruling ensured that the petitioner’s future employment benefits related to seniority, promotion, and increments were preserved, although it confirmed the denial of full salary payment during the suspension period.",

Somayajulu.\n\n3. The judgment was delivered on 16th November 2004.\n\n4. The petitioners in this case were Tati Krishna Veni and Aluvala Sudha Kishore.\n\n5. The respondents in this case were 1. State of A.P., represented by its Public Prosecutor, High Court of A.P., Hyderabad; 2. Sodabattula Sri Sitaramudu; 3. Boru Saini Reddy.\n\n6. The counsel representing the petitioners was Sri P. Venugopala Rao.\n\n7. The counsel for the first respondent was Public Prosecutor.\n\n8. The main contention of the petitioners' counsel was that the first petitioner, being the wife of the brother-in-law of the second respondent, could not be accused of trespassing into the house of her in-laws. They argued that the complaint was mala fide, intended to spite the petitioners because the first petitioner had previously filed a case under Section 498-A IPC against her husband and in-laws. They also argued that the case should be quashed due to the limitation period under Section 468(2)(b) Cr.P.C., as the offence was alleged to have occurred more than a year before cognizance was taken.\n\n9. The incident that led to the filing of the private complaint by the second respondent involved the first petitioner and her relatives allegedly trespassing into the house of the second respondent's in-laws, abusing them, and physically assaulting the second respondent and his wife during a visit for the Pongal festival on 15th January 1999.\n\n10. The alleged incident took place at the house of the second respondent's in-laws.\n\n11. The relationship between the first petitioner and the brother-in-law of the second respondent was that the first petitioner was the wife of the brother-in-law of the second respondent.\n\n12. After the second respondent filed the report, the police conducted an investigation and treated the case as non-cognizable, submitting a final report to that effect.\n\n13. The police treated the case as non-cognizable under Section 352 read with Section 34 IPC.\n\n14. The outcome of the final report submitted by the police was that the police concluded that the incident involved only a hot exchange of words and was non-cognizable.\n\n15. The learned Magistrate dismissed the complaint for offences under Sections 290, 324, 447, and 506 IPC but took cognizance of the case under Section 352 read with Section 34 IPC as C.C.No.1203 of 2000 against the petitioners and the third respondent.\n\n16. The petitioners filed the petition to quash the proceedings in the said C.C. against them.\n\n17. The petitioners argued that the complaint was filed mala fide and was intended to spite the petitioners since the first petitioner had previously filed a case under Section 498-A IPC against her husband and in-laws.\n\n18. The petitioners also argued that the entry of the first petitioner and her relatives into the house of her in-laws could not be considered trespassing.\n\n19. The petitioners contended that since the offence under Section 352 IPC is punishable with imprisonment for three months or a fine, and since the alleged offence occurred on 15th January 1999, the cognizance taken on 3rd October 2000 was barred by time under Section 468(2)(b) Cr.P.C.\n\n20. The petitioners relied on the case of State of Punjab V. Sarwan Singh in support of their contention.\n\n21. The second respondent's counsel argued that since the complaint was filed within time, and since the police did not state that the offence was not committed, the question of quashing the proceedings on the ground of limitation did not arise.\n\n22. The second respondent's counsel relied on the case of State of Himachal Pradesh Vs. Tara Dutt to support their argument.\n\n23. The court found it unnecessary to determine whether a daughter-in-law could trespass into and engage in the acts alleged.\n\n24. The court considered whether the complaint should be quashed on the ground of limitation.\n\n25. The incident allegedly took place on 15th January 1999 at about 8:30 a.m. The second respondent filed the complaint in court on 21st January 1999, within one week from the date of the incident.\n\n26. The second respondent initially filed a private complaint in court because the police did not take action on his report.\n\n27. After the police submitted a final report treating the case as non-cognizable, the second respondent filed a protest petition.\n\n28. The court, after examining the second respondent and his witnesses, took cognizance of the case under Section 352 IPC only.\n\n29. The court held that the delay in taking cognizance of the case was not due to any inaction or laches on the part of the second respondent.\n\n30. The court ultimately dismissed the petition, finding no merit in it, and held that the complaint should not be quashed on the ground of limitation.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The main legal issue is whether the jewelry, part of the \"HEH the Nizam's Jewellery Trust,\" is exempt from wealth tax as a \"work of art\" under Section 5(1)(xii) of the Wealth Tax Act.\n\n2. The judgment was delivered by the Supreme Court of India.\n\n3. The parties involved were the Trustees of \"HEH the Nizam's Jewellery Trust\" and the Commissioner of Wealth Tax.\n\n4. The assessment years under consideration were 1982-83, 1983-84, and 1984-85.\n\n5. The central question was whether the jewelry held in trust could be exempted from wealth tax as \"works of art\" under Section 5(1)(xii) of the Wealth Tax Act.\n\n6. The jewelry involved was a collection of historical and valuable items from the personal collection of the Nizam of Hyderabad and held in trust.\n\n7. The Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, 1972, was relevant for determining whether the jewelry could be classified as \"art treasures\" and thus potentially exempt from wealth tax.\n\n8. Section 5(1)(xii) provides for the exemption of \"works of art\" from wealth tax, and the case hinged on whether the jewelry qualified as such.\n\n9. The trust was created by the Nizam of Hyderabad and established in 1978.\n\n10. The Supreme Court reviewed the Tribunal's decision and judged whether the jewelry could be considered exempt under the Wealth Tax Act.\n\n11. The Government of India issued a notification declaring some of the jewelry as \"art treasures,\" affecting its potential sale or exemption from wealth tax.\n\n12. The Revenue argued that the jewelry should not be exempt from wealth tax as it did not meet the criteria of a \"work of art\" as defined by the Act.\n\n13. The Tribunal decided to exempt the seven items based on their classification as \"works of art\" and their recognition by the Government as art treasures.\n\n14. The court interpreted \"work of art\" broadly, considering historical and cultural significance beyond just physical attributes.\n\n15. The declaration by the Director General recognized the jewelry as \"art treasures,\" which was crucial for its exemption from wealth tax.\n\n16. The court accepted the Tribunal's finding that the jewelry had historical and artistic value and should be considered \"works of art.\"\n\n17. The Trust Deed allowed the trustees to sell the jewelry under specific conditions, including government approval for export.\n\n18. The Trustees decided to sell 37 items out of 65 allowed for sale outside India to comply with the Trust Deed’s conditions and because some items were deemed unnecessary.\n\n19. The court viewed that the Wealth Tax Act’s exemption provisions should align with the Antiquities Act’s definition of art treasures.\n\n20. The court used precedents where art treasures and works of art were discussed to support its interpretation and judgment.\n\n21. The Supreme Court’s directions ensured that the jewelry was preserved and not improperly sold, aligning with legal and trust obligations.\n\n22. The court distinguished \"jewelry\" from \"works of art\" based on historical, cultural, and artistic value rather than physical characteristics alone.\n\n23. Expert committees provided evaluations and classifications of the jewelry, which were crucial in determining its status as \"art treasures.\"\n\n24. The Senior Standing Counsel argued that the Trust’s intention to sell the jewelry should not affect its classification as \"works of art\" or its wealth tax exemption.\n\n25. The court referred to the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act’s definition of \"art treasure,\" including items of significant cultural or historical value.\n\n26. The court interpreted that the Wealth Tax Act should align with the Antiquities Act’s definition of \"art treasures,\" recognizing exempt items as art treasures.\n\n27. The court accepted the Tribunal’s decision based on the jewelry’s classification as \"works of art\" and its alignment with the Antiquities Act.\n\n28. The court affirmed that the Trustees could not sell the 7 items without appropriate permissions, and these items should be exempt from wealth tax.\n\n29. The notification by the Director General confirmed the items as \"art treasures,\" impacting their classification and exemption status under the Wealth Tax Act.\n\n30. The court concluded that the 7 items of jewelry were exempt from wealth tax under Section 5(1)(xii) as they were classified as \"works of art\" and \"art treasures.\"",

State Wakf Board was about allegations of unlawful arrest and detention of individuals, and the alleged non-compliance with government orders regarding the treatment of arrested persons.\n\n2. The petitioners in the case were K.M. Safiulla and others who challenged the actions of the police and the Wakf Board.\n\n3. The petitioners alleged that the police were violating government orders related to the treatment of arrested individuals and that their arrests were conducted improperly.\n\n4. The petitioners claimed that the respondents were violating the government order that mandated specific procedures for handling arrestees.\n\n5. The Sub-Inspector of Police stated that there were no violations of government orders and that proper procedures were followed in the handling of the arrestees.\n\n6. The court instructed that police officers must adhere to proper procedures for handling arrestees, including providing them with adequate rights and maintaining records.\n\n7. The court directed measures to ensure that arrested individuals are treated in accordance with legal standards and that any deviations from these standards are rectified.\n\n8. The primary legal basis for the petition was the alleged violation of government orders and statutory provisions related to the treatment of arrested individuals.\n\n9. The key issue was whether the treatment of arrested individuals complied with the relevant legal and procedural standards.\n\n10. The respondents were the A.P. State Wakf Board and its officials, who were challenged for their actions regarding the petitioners.\n\n11. The petitioner challenged the validity of the actions and decisions made by the Wakf Board, particularly regarding the notice issued under the Wakf Act.\n\n12. The petitioner argued that the notice issued by the Wakf Board was invalid and did not follow the proper legal procedures.\n\n13. The petitioner argued that the proper statutory procedures were not followed in issuing the notice and that the opportunity for a fair hearing was not provided.\n\n14. The outcome was that the court found some merit in the petitioner’s arguments and directed that proper procedures be followed for the issuance and handling of notices.\n\n15. In the second case, the petitioner was a Mutawalli (manager of a Wakf property) who was accused of misconduct.\n\n16. The allegations were related to alleged mismanagement and failure to comply with the provisions of the Wakf Act.\n\n17. The notice was issued under the Wakf Act, which governs the management and administration of Wakf properties.\n\n18. The petitioner challenged the notice on the grounds that it was issued without proper authority and did not follow the statutory requirements for such actions.\n\n19. The petitioner argued that the notice violated statutory procedures by not providing adequate opportunity for a hearing and by not following the prescribed process.\n\n20. The Additional Advocate General argued that the notice was valid and that the proper procedures were followed in issuing it.\n\n21. Legal provisions related to the authority of the Wakf Board and the procedures for issuing notices and taking actions against a Mutawalli were cited in defense.\n\n22. The court decided that the show cause notice was invalid due to non-compliance with procedural requirements and directed that proper procedures be followed.\n\n23. The court emphasized that procedural requirements must be strictly followed for the removal or suspension of a Mutawalli, including providing adequate notice and opportunity to respond.\n\n24. Statutory provisions related to the removal and suspension of a Mutawalli under the Wakf Act include specific procedures for issuing notices and conducting hearings.\n\n25. Safeguards include providing the Mutawalli with a show cause notice, the opportunity to present a defense, and following a fair and transparent process.\n\n26. The court highlighted the importance of issuing show cause notices properly and ensuring that the affected party has the chance to be heard before any action is taken.\n\n27. The petitioner argued that the Wakf Board exceeded its authority in issuing the notice and that the proper statutory process was not followed.\n\n28. The court assessed whether external authorities or influences improperly affected the actions of the Wakf Board and emphasized the need for independent and proper procedural conduct.\n\n29. The representations and letters mentioned in the impugned notice were significant in determining whether the procedural requirements were met and whether the notice was justified.\n\n30. Procedural compliance is crucial for ensuring that administrative actions are valid, fair, and legally enforceable, protecting the rights of the individuals involved.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The main legal issue was whether the disciplinary proceedings against the petitioner were conducted in accordance with the rules and principles of natural justice, and whether the final orders were legally valid.\n\n2.

The District Supply Officer found discrepancies and shortages in stock, which led to the framing of charges against the petitioner.\n\n7. The second Enquiry Officer framed charges related to mismanagement and discrepancies in the stock of essential commodities.\n\n8. The second Enquiry Officer concluded that the petitioner was guilty of the charges based on the evidence presented during the enquiry.\n\n9. The District Collector imposed a penalty of compulsory retirement on the petitioner.\n\n10. The petitioner contended that the disciplinary authority lacked jurisdiction, the enquiry was conducted improperly, and there were procedural irregularities.\n\n11. The Tribunal held that the disciplinary authority had proper jurisdiction based on the relevant rules and regulations governing disciplinary proceedings.\n\n12. The Tribunal considered the amendments to the Andhra Pradesh Civil Services (Disciplinary Proceedings Tribunal) Rules that impacted the conduct of the enquiry and the powers of the disciplinary authority.\n\n13. The Tribunal addressed the claim of non-supply of documents by evaluating whether the petitioner was prejudiced by the lack of documents and whether it impacted the fairness of the enquiry.\n\n14. The petitioner argued that the disciplinary authority did not have jurisdiction under Section 4 of the Act, but the Tribunal found that the authority acted within its jurisdiction.\n\n15. In State of A.P. Vs. Dr. K. Ramachandran, the Supreme Court held that the disciplinary authority must follow the procedural rules, which was relevant in assessing the legality of the proceedings in this case.\n\n16. The Tribunal rejected the plea for a change of the Enquiry Officer, stating that the petitioner did not provide sufficient grounds for such a change.\n\n17. The petitioner argued that the amended Disciplinary Proceedings Rules should apply, but the Tribunal found that the rules in effect at the time of the proceedings were followed.\n\n18. The Tribunal found that despite some irregularities, the overall enquiry process was fair and complied with legal standards.\n\n19. The petitioner claimed that not all witnesses were properly examined, but the Tribunal concluded that the evidence presented was adequate to support the findings.\n\n20.

The Tribunal observed that the petitioner was responsible for the discrepancies and shortages in the stock, as evidenced by the enquiry findings.\n\n25. The petitioner’s request for additional documents was addressed, and the Tribunal found that the documents were either not crucial or had been properly considered.\n\n26. The petitioner argued procedural violations, but the Tribunal concluded that the procedures followed were generally in compliance with legal requirements.\n\n27. The charge memo dated 14-10-1989 outlined the specific charges against the petitioner and was a key document in the disciplinary proceedings.\n\n28. The second Enquiry Officer conducted the enquiry, framed the charges, and provided findings based on the evidence presented.\n\n29. The Tribunal addressed procedural issues raised by the petitioner, evaluating whether any deviations impacted the fairness of the proceedings.\n\n30.

The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The petitioner was a District Registrar.\n\n2. The primary charge was related to alleged misconduct in the discharge of official duties.\n\n3. The District & Sessions Judge passed the order on March 1, 1995.\n\n4. The penalty imposed was reduction in rank and pay.\n\n5. The proceedings were initially governed by the Andhra Pradesh Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1963.\n\n6. The Andhra Pradesh Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1991 came into effect on April 1, 1991.\n\n7. The petitioner argued that the 1991 Rules should have applied to his case as they were more favorable to him.\n\n8. The petitioner argued that the 1991 Rules provided a more detailed and structured procedure for disciplinary actions, which might have benefited him in terms of procedural fairness and protections.\n\n9. A significant difference is that the 1991 Rules required that charges be framed by the disciplinary authority rather than the Enquiry Officer, which was the procedure under the 1963 Rules.\n\n10. The departmental inquiry was conducted by an Enquiry Officer appointed by the disciplinary authority.\n\n11. The Enquiry Officer found the petitioner guilty of the charges against him.\n\n12. The High Court of Andhra Pradesh dismissed the petitioner’s appeal, upholding the disciplinary action and penalty.\n\n13. The petitioner’s counsel contended that the charges should have been framed by the disciplinary authority, not the Enquiry Officer, as per the 1991 Rules.\n\n14. The counsel argued that there was irregularity in the listing of witnesses, which hindered the petitioner’s ability to cross-examine them effectively.\n\n15. The court found that while there were procedural differences, the core principles of fairness and the right to a fair hearing were upheld under both sets of rules.\n\n16. No, the petitioner did not demonstrate actual prejudice resulting from the procedural differences between the 1963 and 1991 Rules.\n\n17. The court referred to the principle that technical defects or irregularities in procedural matters do not invalidate a disciplinary proceeding if no substantial prejudice has been demonstrated.\n\n18. The court viewed the procedural change as a refinement but did not find it to affect the fairness of the proceedings adversely in the petitioner’s case.\n\n19. The court held that under the 1991 Rules, the disciplinary authority was responsible for framing charges, not the Enquiry Officer, reflecting a shift in procedural responsibility.\n\n20. The court noted that while there was a listing of witnesses, the petitioner had the opportunity to cross-examine them and did not show that this listing adversely impacted his defense.\n\n21. The petitioner did not raise the complaint about procedural irregularity at the appropriate time during the disciplinary proceedings.\n\n22. The court emphasized that proving actual prejudice is necessary for challenging disciplinary proceedings based on procedural irregularities.\n\n23. The court differentiates by focusing on whether the procedural defects affected the substantive fairness of the proceedings and whether the petitioner’s rights were materially impacted.\n\n24. The court referenced case law emphasizing that technical defects or procedural errors do not automatically nullify disciplinary actions if they do not result in actual harm or prejudice.\n\n25. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the finding of guilt against the petitioner, regardless of the procedural issues raised.\n\n26. Under the 1963 Rules, the Enquiry Officer was responsible for conducting the inquiry and reporting findings but did not frame the charges.\n\n27. Under the 1991 Rules, the disciplinary authority was responsible for framing the charges, which marked a shift from the earlier practice where the Enquiry Officer might have been involved in this task.\n\n28. The court assesses the validity of disciplinary actions by focusing on whether the procedural defects had a tangible impact on the fairness of the proceedings and whether the petitioner’s rights were compromised.\n\n29. The court applied the principle that administrative actions are not invalidated by procedural defects unless they result in actual prejudice or harm to the affected party.\n\n30. The final outcome was that the writ petition was dismissed by the High Court, upholding the disciplinary action and penalty imposed on the petitioner.",

P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The petitioner was serving as Deputy Nazir in the Court of the Special Judicial First Class Magistrate (Excise), Karimnagar.\n2. The disciplinary action was taken by the District & Sessions Judge, Karimnagar.\n3. The disciplinary order was passed on 01-08-1996.\n4. The penalty imposed was the denial of one increment with cumulative effect and treating the suspension period as not on duty.\n5. The petitioner challenged the disciplinary action based on procedural irregularities, arguing that the inquiry was conducted under the repealed 1963 Rules instead of the 1991 Rules, and that the procedures followed were flawed.\n6. The Andhra Pradesh Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1991 (1991 Rules) were in effect when the charges were framed.\n7. The petitioner’s counsel argued that the inquiry should have been conducted under the 1991 Rules, which offered more favorable procedures for the delinquent employee.\n8. The 1991 Rules provided more opportunities for making representations and required the disciplinary authority to frame the charges rather than the Enquiry Officer.\n9. Under the 1963 Rules, the disciplinary authority could appoint an Enquiry Officer to frame charges and conduct the inquiry.\n10. Under the 1991 Rules, the disciplinary authority itself was required to frame the charges.\n11. The petitioner argued that the Enquiry Officer examined the petitioner before the witnesses, deviating from the usual procedure.\n12. The respondent's counsel argued that no actual prejudice resulted from procedural irregularities and that the issues were technical.\n13. The case established that denial of an increment with cumulative effect should be treated as a major penalty.\n14. Rule 19(2) of the 1963 Rules requires the authority to frame definite charges, provide a statement of allegations, and hold an inquiry if requested.\n15. Rule 20(4) of the 1991 Rules requires the disciplinary authority to deliver a copy of the charges, statement of imputation, and a list of documents and witnesses, and to require a written statement of defense.\n16. Rule 20(16) of the 1991 Rules allows the government servant to state their defense after the disciplinary authority's case is closed, unlike the 1963 Rules.\n17. Rule 21(4) of the 1991 Rules requires providing a copy of the inquiry report and considering any representation before imposing penalties specified in certain clauses.\n18. The court found no substantial difference in procedural fairness between the 1963 and 1991 Rules and concluded that the changes did not result in prejudice.\n19. The court stated that procedural deviations did not harm the petitioner and were largely technical.\n20. The petitioner argued that the Enquiry Officer’s sequence of examination was improper.\n21. The petitioner did not show evidence of prejudice resulting from procedural irregularities.\n22. The Supreme Court in S.B. Noronah v. Prem Kumari established that technical procedural defects alone do not invalidate state action; actual prejudice must be demonstrated.\n23. The court viewed technical procedural defects as insufficient to invalidate proceedings unless actual prejudice was shown.\n24. The court reviews findings based on whether they are supported by legally permissible evidence, not the sufficiency of the evidence.\n25. The petitioner did not demonstrate that the Enquiry Officer’s findings were unsupported by evidence.\n26. The 1991 Rules introduced changes such as requiring the disciplinary authority to frame charges, providing more opportunities for representations, and altering the sequence of defense statements.\n27. The court evaluated that procedural changes did not significantly impact fairness or cause prejudice.\n28. Procedural deviations do not affect the outcome unless they result in actual prejudice.\n29. The court found that procedural irregularities did not cause real harm to the petitioner.\n30. The court dismissed the writ petition, upholding the orders of the District & Sessions Judge and the High Court.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15.

The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The primary issue raised was whether the delay in initiating the departmental proceedings alone was sufficient to quash the charge sheet.\n\n2. The charge memo challenged in the writ petitions was issued by the Inspector General of Police, Police Transport Organisation.\n\n3. The charge memo was issued on September 16, 1997.\n\n4. Nazeer Ahmed challenged the charge sheet on the grounds of delay in initiating the proceedings and the fact that he had been acquitted in a related criminal case.\n\n5. The specific misconduct alleged was the procurement of employment by furnishing false and fabricated transfer certificates.\n\n6. Previously, the Administrative Tribunal had quashed the departmental proceedings due to the charge memo being issued by an unauthorized officer.\n\n7. The earlier proceedings were quashed because the charge memo was issued by an officer who did not have the authority to do so.\n\n8. Nazeer Ahmed was acquitted in the criminal case.\n\n9. The decision to issue a fresh charge memo was based on the acquittal being due to insufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, not on the merits of the misconduct.\n\n10. The standard of proof in departmental proceedings is preponderance of probabilities, while in criminal cases, it is beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n11. The legal principle established is that whether delay alone is sufficient for quashing departmental proceedings depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.\n\n12. The Supreme Court's decision in State of A.P. v. N. Radhakrishnan suggested that there is no predetermined principle; each case must be examined based on its facts and circumstances, including the nature of the charges and the explanation for the delay.\n\n13. The Court views that delay can affect fairness if it is unexplained and prejudices the employee, but it is not a sufficient ground alone to quash proceedings if the delay does not cause prejudice.\n\n14. Rule 20 of the APCS (CC&A) Rules, 1991 provides for conducting an inquiry into misconduct and specifies procedures for submitting a written defense and participating in the inquiry.\n\n15. The charges mentioned in the charge memo were related to the submission of false and fabricated transfer certificates for obtaining employment.\n\n16. The Court justified the continuation of disciplinary proceedings despite the acquittal by stating that criminal and departmental proceedings are distinct, and acquittal in a criminal case does not bar departmental proceedings on the same charges if different standards of proof apply.\n\n17. The decision in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Bani Singh highlighted that charges could be quashed on the grounds of delay if a satisfactory explanation was not provided.\n\n18. The Court distinguishes between criminal and departmental proceedings by the different standards of proof: criminal proceedings require proof beyond reasonable doubt, while departmental proceedings require proof based on the preponderance of probabilities.\n\n19. The seriousness of the charges plays a crucial role, as more serious charges may influence the decision to continue proceedings despite delays.\n\n20. The delay could impact the availability of witnesses and the integrity of evidence, but the Court did not find that the delay alone was sufficient to quash the proceedings.\n\n21. The Court’s stance is that procedural errors do not necessarily invalidate proceedings if the core issues and fairness are preserved.\n\n22. The Court addressed the argument of delay by emphasizing that delay alone, without evidence of prejudice or explanation, is not a sufficient ground for quashing the charge sheet.\n\n23. The writ petitions were dismissed, and no specific order regarding costs was made.\n\n24. The Court balances the need for timely disciplinary proceedings with the rights of the employee by considering the seriousness of the charges, the impact of delay, and whether the delay has caused prejudice to the employee.\n\n25. Procedural flaws included initial issues with the authority of the officer issuing the charge memo, but these were rectified with the issuance of a new memo.\n\n26. The Administrative Tribunal initially quashed the proceedings due to procedural issues but did not rule on the merits of the charges.\n\n27. The failure to submit a written statement of defense could have led to an ex parte inquiry, but it did not directly impact the decision to quash the proceedings in this case.\n\n28. The Court did not apply a hard and fast rule regarding delay, as each case must be evaluated based on its specific facts and circumstances.\n\n29. The Court interpreted that simultaneous criminal and departmental proceedings are permissible as they operate in different jurisdictional areas with distinct standards of proof.\n\n30. The Court considered the nature of the charges, the reasons for the delay, and whether the delay had caused any undue prejudice to Nazeer Ahmed.",

The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The primary issue in the case was whether the non-furnishing of the investigation report, which formed the basis for framing charges against the petitioner, violated principles of natural justice and rendered the enquiry illegal.\n\n2. The parties involved were the petitioner, R. Samba Murthy, and the respondents, including The Chief General Manager, State Bank of India, Local Head Office, Hyderabad.\n\n3. The writ petition was filed on August 8, 2000.\n\n4. The charge sheet was served to the petitioner on September 8, 1993.\n\n5. The petitioner submitted his reply to the charge sheet on October 27, 1993.\n\n6. Before the regular enquiry began, the petitioner requested the furnishing of certain documents, including the investigation report, but these documents were not provided.\n\n7. The Enquiry Officer found the petitioner guilty of the first charge but not guilty of the second charge.\n\n8. The disciplinary action taken against the petitioner on March 11, 1997, was removal from service.\n\n9. The appeal filed by the petitioner was dismissed by the appellate authority on January 29, 1998, confirming the removal order.\n\n10. The petitioner contended that he was not furnished with the investigation report, which formed the basis of the charges, and this omission prejudiced his ability to defend himself.\n\n11. The learned Counsel for the petitioner argued that the non-furnishing of the investigation report violated principles of natural justice and that the charges were vague and the disciplinary process unfair.\n\n12. The learned Standing Counsel for the Bank argued that the investigation report was privileged and not required to be furnished as it was not relied upon by the authorities for finding the petitioner guilty.\n\n13. The principle of natural justice argued to be violated was the right to a fair hearing, which includes the right to be provided with relevant documents necessary for an effective defense.\n\n14. The Supreme Court decided in **STATE OF U.P. vs. SHATRUGHAN LAL** that an employee must be supplied with copies of documents and statements relied upon in the charge sheet to ensure a fair opportunity to respond.\n\n15. The court distinguished the present case from **WP.No.5785/92** based on the fact that in WP.No.5785/92, the documents were not considered in the decision-making process, whereas in the present case, the investigation report was used to frame charges.\n\n16. The respondents claimed the report was a privileged document and that its custodian had claimed privilege, leading to its non-disclosure.\n\n17. The court viewed the claim of privilege as misconceived and unfair, as the document was used by the disciplinary authority to frame charges, making its withholding unreasonable.\n\n18. The non-furnishing of the report was deemed to have prejudiced the petitioner’s ability to defend himself, thus rendering the enquiry unfair and illegal.\n\n19. Yes, the disciplinary authority perused and analyzed the investigation report when framing the charges against the petitioner.\n\n20. The court held that the bank could not claim privilege over the document while using it for framing charges and that failing to provide it to the petitioner was unjust.\n\n21. The court did not delve into the proportionality of the punishment due to the finding that the enquiry was illegal. Therefore, the punishment was not addressed.\n\n22. The investigation report was significant as it was the basis for framing the charges against the petitioner, making it essential for the petitioner to defend himself.\n\n23. Principles of natural justice ensure that the charged employee is given a fair opportunity to defend themselves and that the enquiry process is transparent and impartial.\n\n24. The non-furnishing of the document prevented the petitioner from effectively challenging the charges, thus affecting his defense and fairness of the proceedings.\n\n25. The court’s decision implies that transparency is crucial in disciplinary proceedings, and withholding critical documents undermines the fairness and integrity of the process.\n\n26. The court set aside the orders of the disciplinary and appellate authorities, ruling that the enquiry was illegal and violative of principles of natural justice.\n\n27. The court decided against a fresh enquiry due to the petitioner’s prolonged mental, financial, and psychological ordeal, concluding that a new enquiry was unnecessary.\n\n28. The court identified the non-furnishing of the investigation report as a major procedural flaw that compromised the fairness and legality of the enquiry.\n\n29. The court justified its decision by stating that the non-furnishing of a crucial document violated natural justice principles and rendered the enquiry unfair and illegal.\n\n30. The case highlights that privileged documents cannot be used selectively by the authorities. If a document is used to frame charges, it must be disclosed to the charged individual to ensure fairness in the proceedings.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The petitioner is Ram Avtar & Co., through its proprietor Shri Ram Avatar.\n2. The respondents are IBP Company Ltd. and another unnamed respondent.\n3. The High Court handling the case is the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jaipur Bench.\n4. The case number is S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 3862/2001.\n5. The date of the order is 13.08.2007.\n6. The judge presiding over the case is Hon'ble Mr. Justice K.S. Rathore.\n7. The petitioner’s business was the sale of kerosene oil under a license issued by the District Supply Officer and a dealership from IBP Company.\n8. The FIR was lodged based on a raid conducted by the Deputy Superintendent of Police (Intelligence) from the Anti-Corruption Bureau, Jaipur.\n9. The FIR was lodged on 09.01.2001.\n10. The allegations were that the petitioner conspired to supply less quantity of kerosene to fair price shops, used forged documents to show full distribution, and sold the kerosene at a higher price to factories and other institutions.\n11. The District Supply Officer canceled the petitioner’s license on 12.03.2001 following the FIR.\n12. The IBP Company issued a show cause notice to the petitioner on 13/16.01.2001.\n13. The termination order by IBP Company was issued on 28.06.2001.\n14. The petitioner contends that the IBP Company should restore the dealership since the District Supply Officer has restored the license and the Anti-Corruption Department has not filed a challan.\n15. The District Supply Officer’s order on 16.02.2005 restored the petitioner’s license.\n16. The petitioner argues that since the license was restored by the District Supply Officer, the IBP Company should restore the dealership and withdraw the termination order.\n17. The respondents raised objections regarding the maintainability of the writ petition, the jurisdiction of the court, and the appropriateness of a writ remedy for contractual disputes.\n18. Clause 26 of the Dealership Agreement specifies that disputes should be litigated in New Delhi, where the courts have jurisdiction.\n19. The respondents cited judgments stating that suits must be filed in the specified jurisdiction mentioned in the agreement, including AIR 2002 SC 2402, AIR 2002 Madras 396, and AIR 2002 Orissa 29.\n20. The respondents argued that the appropriate remedy for contractual disputes is not a writ petition but adjudication through a Civil Court.\n21. The respondents argued that the petitioner’s claim for specific performance of the contract was not appropriate and should be pursued for compensation instead.\n22. The respondents argued that specific performance of the contract is barred and not applicable for such cases, referencing judgments such as 2002(4) WLC 742.\n23. The petitioner argued that the Anti-Corruption Department had no jurisdiction to raid and lodge an FIR against a private company and its proprietor.\n24. The court suggested that the petitioner could challenge the FIR through appropriate legal remedies but did not take action on the FIR within this writ petition.\n25. The court found the M/s Pali Filling Station case not applicable because the facts and circumstances differed from those in Ram Avtar & Co. vs. IBP Company Ltd.\n26. The court concluded that the respondent IBP Company could not be compelled to restore the dealership and withdraw the termination order.\n27. The court viewed the District Supply Officer’s order restoring the license as not sufficient to compel the IBP Company to restore the dealership.\n28. The court did not address the Anti-Corruption Department’s jurisdiction directly but noted that the petitioner did not challenge the FIR or the Anti-Corruption Department’s actions.\n29. The outcome of the writ petition was that it was dismissed.\n30. The court dismissed the writ petition on the grounds that the petitioner had not pursued the appropriate legal remedies and that the IBP Company’s decision to terminate the dealership was valid based on the breach of contract.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The\n  case number for this revision petition is S.B. Criminal Revision Petition No.\n  1098/2006.\n    \n    2. The order was passed on May 31, 2007.\n    \n    3. The case is being handled by the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan\n  at Jodhpur.\n    \n    4. The petitioner in this case is Mahesh Inani.\n    \n    5. The counsels representing the petitioner are Mr. Pradeep Shah, Mr. R.K.\n  Charan, and Mr. V.K. Mathur.\n    \n    6. The Government Advocate for the case is Mr. S.K. Vyas.\n    \n    7. The complainant is represented by Mr. Sandeep Mehta.\n    \n    8. The primary challenge made by the petitioner in this revision petition\n  is against the order framing charges under Sections 13 (2) and 13 (1) (d) of\n  the Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 120-B IPC.\n    \n    9. The charges framed against the petitioner were under Sections 13 (2) and\n  13 (1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and Section 120-B\n  IPC.\n    \n    10. At the time of the alleged offense, the petitioner was the Chairman of\n  the Municipal Council, Chittorgarh.\n    \n    11. The sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act cited in the charges\n  were Sections 13 (2) and 13 (1) (d).\n    \n    12. The amount allegedly involved in the loss to the Municipal Council was\n  Rs. 8,60,254/-.\n    \n    13. The petitioner was accused of accepting tenders for supply of fountains\n  at rates above 24% of the market rate, causing a loss to the Municipal\n  Council.\n    \n    14. The financial power limit for the petitioner, according to the\n  government notification, was Rs. 5,00,000/-.\n    \n    15. The alleged irregularity was that 60% of the payment was made to the\n  firms without installation of the fountains.\n    \n    16. The defense argued that prosecution sanction was refused for Mahesh\n  Chandra Sharma, who was also implicated, and that the charges were the same\n  as those against Mahesh Chandra Sharma.\n    \n    17. The outcome of the departmental enquiry against Mahesh Chandra Sharma\n  was that the charges of corruption were not proved, and no delinquency was\n  found.\n    \n    18. The petitioner argued that he should be discharged from the charges\n  because the charges were the same as those levelled against Mahesh Chandra\n  Sharma, and no case was made out for his prosecution.\n    \n    19. The court ordered that the trial court complete the trial expeditiously\n  as directed in previous orders.\n    \n    20. The petitioner’s role in the Municipal Council was that of\n  Chairman.\n    \n    21. The Public Prosecutor and the complainant’s counsel argued that the\n  petitioner had financial authority exceeding his limit, and that he was\n  involved in illegal activities, including accepting tenders above market rates\n  and making premature payments.\n    \n    22. After framing the charges, the trial court proceeded to examine\n  prosecution witnesses and allowed the petitioner to cross-examine them.\n    \n    23. Four prosecution witnesses were examined during the trial.\n    \n    24. The key issue with the prosecution’s case, as argued by the petitioner,\n  was that there was no case for the charges, and that the petitioner should\n  not be held liable when the Executive Officer, who was also implicated, was\n  not prosecuted.\n    \n    25. The court decided that at this stage, it should not interfere with the\n  proceedings of the trial and that the petitioner’s challenge against the\n  charges was not sufficient to quash them.\n    \n    26. The petitioner argued that he should be treated equally as Mahesh\n  Chandra Sharma, who was not prosecuted despite similar charges.\n    \n    27. The precedent case cited to support the court’s decision was SB\n  Criminal Revision Petition No. 642/1998, which held that a revision petition\n  against framing charges could not be entertained once the trial had\n  commenced.\n    \n    28. The court decided to dismiss the petitioner’s revision petition,\n  upholding the decision to frame charges and proceed with the trial.\n    \n    29. The petitioner’s case was not considered comparable to Mahesh Chandra\n  Sharma’s because the petitioner was the decision-making authority, whereas\n  Mahesh Chandra Sharma was the executive officer and thus subject to different\n  handling by the government.\n    \n    30. Following the court’s decision, the petitioner would continue to\n  participate in the trial, which was directed to proceed expeditiously.",

The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17.

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C.

P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10.

Gaur.\n    \n    5. The State of Rajasthan was represented by Mr. S.K. Vyas, Government\n  Advocate.\n    \n    6. The petitioner sought to quash the suspension order dated 30.5.2005 and\n  the FIR dated 2.5.2005.\n    \n    7. Babu Singh Dhariwal was posted as Assistant Engineer, CAD Mohangarh\n  Sub-Division 4, Indira Gandhi Nahar Project (IGNP), Mohangarh, District\n  Jaisalmer.\n    \n    8. The complaint was about Babu Singh Dhariwal, along with Shri P.B. Mathur\n  and others, issuing a cheque of Rs. 2,00,000/- to a contractor without\n  completing the construction work.\n    \n    9. The other individuals named in the FIR were Shri P.B. Mathur (Executive\n  Engineer) and Shri Ramesh Chandra Joshi (Junior Engineer).\n    \n    10. The cheque issued was for Rs. 2,00,000/-.\n    \n    11. The cheque was dishonored due to it being received back from the bank\n  as it was dishonored.\n    \n    12. The Committee's report, submitted on 5.5.2005, stated that the\n  construction work was done legally.\n    \n    13. The suspension order challenged by the petitioner was dated\n  30.5.2005.\n    \n    14. The petitioner argued that the suspension order was invalid because it\n  was issued by the Deputy Secretary, who lacked jurisdiction, and the order\n  was made in haste without proper investigation.\n    \n    15. The petitioner claimed that the Deputy Secretary did not have the\n  jurisdiction to issue the suspension order; only the Secretary of the\n  Irrigation Department, who is the Appointing Authority, had that\n  jurisdiction.\n    \n    16. The petitioner justified that no illegal payment was made by claiming\n  that the construction work was legally completed, and any payment made was\n  based on the work done, which was verified by the Committee.\n    \n    17. The petitioner argued that the cheque was issued before the work\n  started, which was irregular. However, the petitioner claimed that the work\n  was eventually completed.\n    \n    18. The Government Advocate responded that the payment was made before the\n  completion of work and was illegal as the work had not started when the\n  cheque was issued.\n    \n    19. The Government Advocate stated that the work had not started by\n  7.4.2005, as verified by the Anti-Corruption Bureau, even though the cheque\n  was issued on 31.3.2005.\n    \n    20. The petitioner’s lawyer argued that the suspension order was made in\n  haste without proper application of mind, as it was issued despite the\n  Committee's favorable report and the lack of completion of the\n  investigation.\n    \n    21. The Government Advocate stated that the suspension order was passed by\n  the State Government in accordance with the Rules, and the Deputy Secretary's\n  role was in line with the Rules of Business, which required the order to bear\n  his signature.\n    \n    22. The allegations made against the petitioner included financial\n  illegality, corruption, and making illegal payments to the contractor before\n  the completion of work.\n    \n    23. The Court viewed the suspension as a non-punitive administrative action\n  taken in contemplation of a departmental enquiry, not as a punishment.\n    \n    24. The Court dismissed the petitioner's request to quash the FIR because\n  it found that there were serious allegations that required investigation, and\n  the FIR was based on credible information regarding financial\n  irregularities.\n    \n    25. The Court applied the principle that suspension is a non-punitive\n  administrative measure and should be reviewed in the context of the\n  allegations, enquiries, and circumstances surrounding the case.\n    \n    26. The Court said that the suspension was justified in light of the\n  serious allegations of financial illegality and the need for a departmental\n  enquiry, indicating that it was not a punishment but a procedural\n  measure.\n    \n    27. The Court found that the cheque was issued before the work had started,\n  which was a significant irregularity and supported the need for further\n  investigation.\n    \n    28. The Court addressed the issue by noting that while the Deputy Secretary\n  issued the order, it was done in accordance with the Rules of Business, and\n  the Secretary's authority was reflected in the administrative process.\n    \n    29. The Court concluded that an investigation was necessary to address the\n  serious allegations of financial illegality and corruption, and it should be\n  conducted by the appropriate investigative agency.\n    \n    30. The Court dismissed the writ petition, finding no grounds to quash the\n  FIR or the suspension order, and upheld the procedural validity of the\n  suspension and the need for investigation.",

The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts.

P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17.

D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30.

The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The\n  petitioner in this case is R.N. Anand.\n    2. The respondents in this case are the Government of India, Ministry of\n  Home Affairs, represented by the Secretary, Department of Personnel and\n  Administration Reforms, North Block, New Delhi, and others.\n    3. The main issue in the case is whether the petitioner is entitled to an\n  extension of the time limit to avail of the Traveling Allowance (TA) after\n  his retirement.\n    4. The petitioner’s position at the time of his retirement was Deputy Director.\n    5. The petitioner retired from his position on 31st July 1997.\n    6. The petitioner is seeking the benefit of Traveling Allowance (TA) to\n  settle down in his hometown after retirement.\n    7. The general rule is that the Traveling Allowance (TA) can be availed of\n  at any time during Leave Preparatory to Retirement (LPR) or within one year\n  of the date of retirement.\n    8. The time limit for availing TA can be extended in special cases by the\n  Administrative Ministries/Departments concerned under SR 147 of the\n  Government of India.\n    9. The petitioner sought an extension of the time limit for TA because his\n  General Provident Fund (GPF) account had not been settled at the time of his\n  retirement.\n    10. The authorities responded to the petitioner’s request by stating that\n  the non-settlement of the GPF was not a sufficient reason for the extension\n  of the time limit for TA.\n    11. The Central Administrative Tribunal dismissed the petitioner’s\n  application by an order dated 18th February 2000.\n    12. A banker's cheque for Rs. 12,750/- was given to the petitioner as part\n  of the final settlement of his General Provident Fund (GPF).\n    13. The petitioner contends that the respondents did not properly consider\n  sub-rule (4) of Rule 11 of the General Provident Fund (Central Services)\n  Rules.\n    14. Rule 34 of the General Provident Fund (Central Services) Rules pertains\n  to the manner of payment of the amount in the fund to the subscriber or his\n  beneficiaries.\n    15. Rule 35 of the General Provident Fund (Central Services) Rules pertains\n  to the conditions of subscription to the GPF, including the circumstances\n  under which a subscriber may choose not to subscribe during leave.\n    16. The petitioner contended that the amount of interest on his GPF had not\n  been properly calculated and only a portion of the interest was paid after\n  filing the writ application.\n    17. The respondents did not provide clear details on how the interest on\n  the petitioner’s GPF was calculated from 1973 to June 2000.\n    18. The role of the Accounts Officer as per Rule 34 is to ensure the\n  payment of the amount standing to the credit of the subscriber in the GPF\n  when it becomes payable, including issuing payment authority and verifying\n  the ledger account.\n    19. The date 7th September 1999 is significant because it was when the\n  respondents informed the petitioner that the non-settlement of his GPF was\n  not a sufficient reason to extend the time limit for TA.\n    20. The petitioner claimed that there was no evidence to support the\n  tribunal’s assumption that he did not want to leave Hyderabad because his\n  wife was employed there.\n    21. The court opined that the authorities’ discretion in extending the time\n  limit for TA should have been exercised reasonably, taking into consideration\n  the relevant factors and the law.\n    22. Discretion should be exercised reasonably, not capriciously, and should\n  be guided by law. It must not be arbitrary, vague, or fanciful, and should\n  involve good faith in discharging public duty.\n    23. The court viewed the tribunal’s rejection of the petitioner’s\n  contention as based on an unsupported assumption, and it lacked proper\n  consideration of the relevant facts.\n    24. The doctrine of self-restraint refers to the court's decision to allow\n  the statutory authority to pass an appropriate order at the first instance\n  rather than exercising the same power itself.\n    25. The court directed the respondents to reconsider the matter afresh and\n  pass an appropriate order within two weeks from the date of communication of\n  the order.\n    26. The court decided not to exercise the power itself in this case due to\n  the doctrine of self-restraint, allowing the statutory authority to act first.\n    27. The court noted that the petitioner’s representations were not disposed\n  of expeditiously, and no explanation was provided for the delay.\n    28. The petitioner’s representations and reminders are significant because\n  they highlight the lack of timely response from the authorities, which\n  contributed to the delay in settling his GPF.\n    29. The court emphasized the importance of good faith in discharging public\n  duty, implying that the authorities must act within the scope of the law and\n  avoid arbitrary decisions.\n    30. The final direction given by the court to the respondents was to\n  reconsider the petitioner’s request for TA in light of all relevant factors\n  and pass an appropriate order within two weeks.",

Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. 1. The\n  appellant is Dr. Navarathan Singh.\n    \n    2. The respondent is the State of Andhra Pradesh, represented by its\n  D.S.P., ACB, Nizamabad Range, Nizamabad.\n    \n    3.

The appellant was charged under Sections 7 and 13(1)(d) read with 13(2)\n  of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.\n    \n    5. The allegation was that the appellant demanded and accepted Rs.750 as a\n  bribe for providing proper medical treatment to the complainant's\n  daughter.\n    \n    6. The trial court found the appellant guilty and sentenced him to one year\n  of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.500 under each section. The\n  sentences were to run concurrently.\n    \n    7. The appellant was working as a Medical Officer at the Community Health\n  Centre, Bodhan, Nizamabad District at the time of the alleged offense.\n    \n    8. The complainant was a resident of Rudrur, Nizamabad District, whose\n  pregnant daughter was admitted to the hospital where the appellant\n  worked.\n    \n    9. The complainant's daughter was admitted to the hospital on February 12,\n  1997, and the appellant, after examining her, demanded a bribe for performing\n  an operation.\n    \n    10. The complainant managed to pay Rs.1,500 out of the demanded Rs.2,250 by\n  mortgaging and selling jewelry.\n    \n    11. The appellant allegedly harassed the complainant for the remaining\n  Rs.750.\n    \n    12. The complainant approached the D.S.P., A.C.B., and lodged a complaint\n  on February 25, 1997.\n    \n    13. A trap was laid by the A.C.B. on February 26, 1997, where the appellant\n  was caught accepting the bribe.\n    \n    14. The prosecution presented nine witnesses (PWs) and marked exhibits and\n  material objects to support its case.\n    \n    15. PW-1, the complainant, turned hostile and did not support the\n  prosecution's case.\n    \n    16. PW-2, the accompanying witness during the trap, testified that the\n  appellant accepted the money and kept it under a pen stand.\n    \n    17. PW-3, a jeweler, testified that the complainant had sold jewelry to\n  raise money to pay the appellant.\n    \n    18. PW-4, the landlord of the appellant’s clinic, did not provide any\n  significant evidence.\n    \n    19. PW-5, a Deputy Civil Surgeon, confirmed that the complainant’s daughter\n  was treated at the hospital by the appellant.\n    \n    20. PW-6, a Judicial Magistrate, recorded the complainant’s statement under\n  Section 164 Cr.P.C.\n    \n    21. PW-7 testified about the sanction order for the prosecution of the\n  appellant.\n    \n    22. PW-8 testified that the complainant had informed him about the\n  appellant’s demand for a bribe, and he assisted her in drafting the\n  complaint.\n    \n    23. PW-9, the D.S.P., detailed the procedures of the trap and the\n  subsequent investigation.\n    \n    24. The appellant's defense was that the money was given for the treatment\n  of the complainant's nephew, not as a bribe.\n    \n    25. The lower court found the appellant guilty, relying heavily on the\n  testimony of PW-2 and other circumstantial evidence.\n    \n    26. The appellant argued that the prosecution failed to prove beyond a\n  reasonable doubt that the money was demanded as a bribe.\n    \n    27. The prosecution's case was weakened by the failure to prove the demand\n  for a bribe and the absence of direct evidence linking the payment to any\n  illegal favor.\n    \n    28. The judgment was criticized for shifting the burden of proof to the\n  appellant instead of requiring the prosecution to establish guilt beyond a\n  reasonable doubt.\n    \n    29. The court noted inconsistencies in the prosecution’s case, such as the\n  lack of proof that the money was paid in the government hospital and not in\n  the private clinic.\n    \n    30. The appeal was allowed, and the appellant was given the benefit of the\n  doubt, leading to the setting aside of the conviction and sentence.",

Jankiraman judgment was significant because it established the\n  principle of \"sealed cover\" for promotions in certain cases.\n    The respondent's argument was based on the interpretation of the state\n  government's OM and its applicability to the specific circumstances of the\n  case.\n    The court's decision on whether the respondent's argument was valid is not\n  provided in the given information.\n    The main points of contention likely revolved around the interpretation of\n  the OMs and their applicability to the respondent's case.\n    The information provided does not mention any specific legal precedents or\n  previous cases cited by either party.\n    The court's final decision in the case is not provided in the given\n  information.\n    The information provided does not mention any dissenting opinions among the\n  judges.\n    The implications of the court's decision for government employees facing\n  disciplinary proceedings would depend on the specific outcome of the\n  case.\n    The case could have broader implications for the promotion process in\n  government organizations, depending on how the court interpreted the OMs and\n  their applicability.\n    The information provided does not mention any public reactions or\n  discussions.\n    The information provided does not indicate whether the case led to any\n  changes in government policies or procedures.\n    The case might have raised ethical considerations related to the balance\n  between fairness to employees and the need to maintain discipline within the\n  government.\n    The case might have involved complex legal arguments related to the\n  interpretation of the OMs and their application to specific\n  circumstances.\n    The information provided does not mention any procedural challenges or\n  delays.\n    The case might have highlighted any weaknesses or loopholes in the existing\n  legal framework related to promotions and disciplinary proceedings.\n    Whether the case was considered a landmark case would depend on its\n  long-term impact and influence on subsequent cases.\n    The case could have implications for the relationship between the\n  government and its employees, particularly in terms of trust and\n  fairness.\n    The information provided does not mention any international\n  reactions.\n    The case might have raised concerns about the fairness and transparency of\n  the promotion process, particularly if the court's decision was seen as\n  unfair or arbitrary.\n    The information provided does not explicitly mention any issues related to\n  corruption or nepotism.\n    The information provided does not mention any questions about the adequacy\n  of the evidence.\n    The case could have implications for the rights and privileges of\n  government employees, particularly in terms of their ability to contest\n  disciplinary actions or promotions decisions.\n    The information provided does not mention any political implications or\n  ramifications.\n    The information provided does not mention any conflicts of interest or\n  biases.\n    The information provided does not mention any public interest groups or\n  organizations that intervened.\n    The information provided does not allow for a definitive conclusion on\n  whether the case had any long-term implications for the functioning of the\n  Indian government.",

The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18.

The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25.

It found\n  that while the petitioners were in possession of large sums of money, there\n  was no proof that this money was intended for or used in bribery.\n    The information provided does not mention any dissenting opinions among the\n  judges.\n    The information provided does not mention any procedural irregularities or\n  challenges.\n    The case involved legal arguments related to the interpretation of the IPC\n  provisions on bribery and the need to prove the specific elements of the\n  offense.\n    The case might have provided guidance on the interpretation of bribery laws\n  in the context of elections.\n    The information provided does not mention any public reactions or\n  discussions.\n    The case did not lead to any reforms or changes in the relevant laws.\n    The case could have raised ethical considerations related to the\n  presumption of guilt and the importance of strong evidence in criminal\n  cases.\n    The information provided does not mention any conflicts of interest or\n  biases.\n    The information provided does not mention any public interest groups or\n  organizations that intervened.\n    The case did not have any long-term implications for the functioning of the\n  Indian government.\n    The case could have raised concerns about the fairness and transparency of\n  the judicial system if there were any perceived irregularities.\n    The information provided does not mention any challenges or obstacles faced\n  by the prosecution or defense.\n    The information provided does not mention any procedural delays or\n  backlogs.\n    The case might have raised questions about the sufficiency of the evidence\n  presented by the prosecution.\n    The case could have raised questions about the effectiveness of the Indian\n  legal system in investigating and prosecuting bribery cases.\n    The impact on public trust would depend on the public's perception of the\n  case and the court's ruling.\n    The information provided does not mention any international\n  reactions.\n    The case could have highlighted the need for stronger evidence or clearer\n  legal definitions to prove bribery in election-related cases.\n    The case might have had political implications if the allegations had been\n  proven, but since the petitioners were acquitted, the political impact was\n  likely limited.\n    The information provided does not mention any attempts to influence the\n  outcome of the case.\n    The case could serve as a precedent for future cases involving similar\n  allegations, emphasizing the need for strong evidence to prove bribery.\n    The case provided guidance on the interpretation of the term\n  \"bribery\" in the context of elections, clarifying that merely\n  possessing large sums of money is not sufficient to prove bribery without\n  evidence of a corrupt intent.\n    The case provided guidance on the elements that need to be proven to\n  establish the offense of bribery under Section 171-E of the IPC, emphasizing\n  the need to demonstrate that a person gave or accepted a gratification with\n  the intent to influence electoral rights.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30.

P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17.

The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. The\n  main legal issue was whether the premature retirement order was stigmatic and\n  amounted to a dismissal under Article 311 of the Constitution of India.\n    The parties involved were Ajmer Singh Ramana (Petitioner) and the State of\n  Punjab & Anr. (Respondents).\n    The petitioner was challenging the premature retirement order (Annexure\n  P-1) and related orders that allegedly stigmatized his service record.\n    The petitioner challenged the order on the grounds that it was stigmatic\n  and violated his rights under Article 311, which protects against dismissal\n  or removal without due process.\n    The petitioner specifically challenged the orders dated 14.5.2008 (Annexure\n  P-1) and 20.8.2009 (Annexure P-5), along with the Annual Confidential Reports\n  for certain periods.\n    The court interpreted the comments in the premature retirement order as\n  stigmatic, which suggested the petitioner’s service was not\n  satisfactory.\n    The court determined the stigmatic nature of the order by examining whether\n  it carried any implication of misconduct or inefficiency that could damage\n  the petitioner’s future prospects.\n    The discussion revolved around Article 311 of the Constitution of India,\n  which deals with the dismissal, removal, or reduction in rank of government\n  servants.\n    The petitioner’s counsel relied on legal precedents such as \"Baikuntha\n  Nath Das vs. Chief District Medical Officer, Baripada\" to argue that the\n  order was punitive.\n    The court found the case \"Union of India vs. J.N. Sinha\" relevant\n  but distinguished it on the grounds that the facts were different and not\n  fully applicable.\n    The respondent-State argued that the order was not stigmatic but was passed\n  in the public interest based on the petitioner’s service record.\n    The court assessed the petitioner’s service record and found that it\n  included negative remarks and adverse entries that justified the retirement\n  order.\n    The court stated that a departmental inquiry was not necessary for\n  premature retirement if it was in the public interest and based on the\n  service record.\n    The court applied the legal principle that if an order affects a person’s\n  reputation or career prospects, it may be considered stigmatic.\n    The court found that the petitioner’s Annual Confidential Reports indicated\n  a consistent decline in performance, justifying the premature\n  retirement.\n    The court concluded that the premature retirement order was not punitive as\n  it was based on the overall service record and was in the public\n  interest.\n    The court distinguished between compulsory retirement and dismissal by\n  stating that the former does not necessarily imply any misconduct or\n  inefficiency.\n    The comments in the petitioner’s service record played a crucial role in\n  the court’s decision, as they reflected negatively on his performance.\n    The court interpreted Rule 3.26(d) of the Punjab Civil Services Rules to\n  mean that the premature retirement was justified based on the petitioner’s\n  service record.\n    The court rejected the petitioner’s claim that the order was arbitrary,\n  stating that it was based on a fair assessment of the service record.\n    The court held that the petitioner’s right to a post-retirement pension was\n  unaffected by the premature retirement, as it was not a dismissal or\n  removal.\n    The court ultimately dismissed the writ petition, upholding the premature\n  retirement order.\n    The court addressed the petitioner’s argument about natural justice by stating\n  that the principles were not violated as the order was not punitive.\n    The court noted that mandatory consultation with the High Court was\n  required in cases involving judicial officers, but this was not applicable in\n  the petitioner’s case.\n    The court concluded that the petitioner’s retirement was in line with the\n  rules governing premature retirement and was not punitive in nature.\n    The court viewed the petitioner’s overall conduct as a government servant\n  as unsatisfactory, based on the service record.\n    The petitioner’s Annual Confidential Reports had a significant impact on\n  the court’s decision, as they indicated poor performance and conduct.\n    The court interpreted that the petitioner was not entitled to the protections\n  under Article 311 because the order was not a dismissal or removal.\n    The court balanced public interest and individual rights by stating that\n  premature retirement was justified if it served the public good and was not\n  punitive.\n    The key factors influencing the court’s ruling were the petitioner’s\n  service record, the nature of the premature retirement order, and the\n  application of relevant legal principles.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. Akhtar\n  Alam was charged with obtaining a bribe by resorting to corrupt and illegal\n  means.\n    He was convicted under Section 5(2) read with Section 5(1)(d) of the\n  Prevention of Corruption Act.\n    He was the Head Clerk to the Executive Electrical Engineer of the State\n  Electricity Board.\n    The offence allegedly occurred on July 8, 1961.\n    The appellant argued that he was not a public servant under the Prevention\n  of Corruption Act or the Indian Penal Code.\n    The findings on questions of fact by the High Court were not\n  challenged.\n    Section 5(1)(d) defines criminal misconduct as obtaining any valuable thing\n  or pecuniary advantage by corrupt or illegal means or by otherwise abusing\n  one’s position as a public servant.\n    Section 2 defines 'public servant' as one who falls under Section 21 of the\n  Indian Penal Code.\n    Section 21 includes officers in the service or pay of government or local\n  authorities or corporations.\n    The High Court found that Akhtar Alam was a public servant under Section 21\n  of the Indian Penal Code.\n    Section 81 of the Electricity (Supply) Act was referenced.\n    Akhtar Alam could not be deemed a public servant under Section 81 because\n  the act of taking a bribe was not in pursuance of the Act’s provisions.\n    In Gill v. The King, it was decided that prosecution for taking a bribe did\n  not require government sanction.\n    The Federal Court in Hori Ram Singh v. The Crown decided that sanction was\n  not required for charges unrelated to the official duties of a public\n  servant.\n    Clause Twelfth of Section 21 includes every officer in the service or pay\n  of a corporation established by or under an Act or Government company.\n    The Head Clerk was found to perform duties immediately auxiliary to the\n  Executive Engineer.\n    An ‘officer’ is someone in the service of the corporation who is either\n  armed with authority or whose duties are immediately auxiliary to someone who\n  is.\n    Reg. v. Ramajirao Jivbaji defined an officer as someone who exercises\n  delegated government functions or is auxiliary to such an officer.\n    Nazamuddin v. Queen-Empress held that a peon could be considered an officer\n  if his duties were auxiliary to those of a higher officer.\n    The Lahore High Court considered a Head Clerk as a public officer due to\n  the auxiliary nature of their duties.\n    The Supreme Court in G. A. Monterio v. The State of Ajmer found that a\n  Class III servant whose duties were auxiliary to an officer was a public\n  servant.\n    The two criteria are being in the service or pay of the corporation and\n  either having authority or performing duties immediately auxiliary to someone\n  with authority.\n    Yes, the designation ‘Head Clerk’ was indicative of an officer position as\n  per the case findings.\n    The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Patna High Court.\n    Akhtar Alam was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for five years under\n  Section 5(2) and two years under Section 161 of the Indian Penal Code.\n    Ramprit Singh, Basudeo Singh, and other witnesses were involved in the\n  trap.\n    The Deputy Superintendent of Police organized and led the raid, and\n  collected evidence against Akhtar Alam.\n    The bribe amount was Rs. 180/- (eighteen ten-rupee notes).\n    Primary prosecution witnesses included Ramprit Singh, Basudeo Singh, and\n  the Deputy Superintendent of Police.\n    The Supreme Court concluded that Akhtar Alam was a public servant under\n  Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. Mutual\n  consent involves the agreement of both parties. If one party decides to end\n  the arrangement, the consent ceases, and the wife can claim\n  maintenance.\n    If mutual consent is withdrawn, the wife can claim maintenance, subject to\n  any defenses the husband may raise.\n    Yes, the lower court agreed that the respondent is entitled to maintenance\n  from the petitioner.\n    Factors included the petitioner’s remarriage, financial commitments, the\n  respondent’s long-term maintenance by relations, and her own earnings.\n    The maintenance amount was reduced from ₹15 to ₹7-8 per month.\n    The previous maintenance amount awarded by the lower court was ₹15 per\n  month.\n    The court reduced the amount due to the petitioner’s financial commitments\n  and the respondent’s independent earnings.\n    The petitioner argued that a sudden financial burden would significantly\n  impact his resources, given his remarriage and children.\n    The respondent had been maintained by her relations and was earning at\n  least ₹7 per month.\n    The final maintenance amount awarded by the court was ₹7-8 per month.\n    The appeal concerned the execution of a decree and objections related to\n  its executability.\n    The appellant raised objections about the decree’s executability, including\n  issues of insolvency and the Official Receiver’s involvement.\n    The court held that objections to the general executability of the decree\n  should have been raised during the decree's transmission.\n    No, objections regarding specific properties could be raised during\n  execution proceedings, not during transmission.\n    The court decided that while objections about property could be raised\n  during execution, the appellant’s general objections were precluded.\n    The appeal was dismissed, and the costs were partially awarded to the\n  respondent.\n    A continuing offence is defined as one where a person is first convicted of\n  an offence and then continues to commit the same offence again.\n    The petitioner was accused of erecting a factory without permission, and\n  later of running it.\n    The court quashed the new prosecution, stating that the previous acquittal\n  barred further prosecution under the same charges.\n    A previous acquittal prevents further prosecution for the same offence, as\n  it constitutes a bar to subsequent charges.\n    The accused offered a bribe to a Textile Officer who had rejected their\n  permit application.\n    The Textile Officer was functus officio regarding the permit request at the\n  time the bribe was offered.\n    No, the accused was not found guilty under Section 160, as the officer was\n  no longer in a position to decide on the permit.\n    The court found that the erection of a factory was not a continuing offence;\n  only the operation of the factory could be.\n    The court found no substance in the objection about the property being\n  disposed of by the Official Receiver.\n    The court decided that the erection of a factory could not be deemed a\n  continuing offence and did not bar the new proceedings.\n    The court rejected the appellant’s objections, noting that objections about\n  executability should have been raised earlier or during execution.\n    The court determined that the maintenance amount was high considering the\n  petitioner’s financial situation and the respondent’s earnings.\n    The court found no valid reason to adjust the decision based on the\n  Official Receiver’s property disposal.\n    The court held that the accused did not commit bribery as the Textile\n  Officer was not in a position to decide on the matter.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. Anand\n  Prakash was charged under Sections 7 and 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of\n  Corruption Act, 1988.\n    Anand Prakash was found guilty and convicted for offenses under Section 7\n  and Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. He was sentenced\n  to two years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs. 5,000 for each offense,\n  with concurrent sentences.\n    Anand Prakash, a court reader, allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs. 50 from a\n  complainant, Raj Kumar, for providing a certified copy of a court\n  order.\n    Raj Kumar filed the complaint on March 6, 1995.\n    Anand Prakash was accused of accepting a bribe of Rs. 50.\n    The CBI arranged a trap where treated currency notes were given to Raj\n  Kumar to be handed over to Anand Prakash on demand.\n    Inspector Azad Singh was the Investigating Officer who organized the\n  raiding team and oversaw the trap operation.\n    The evidence collected included the tainted money, hand washes, and pocket\n  washes of Anand Prakash which tested positive for phenolphthalein.\n    Anand Prakash denied the charges, arguing that he did not demand or accept\n  a bribe and raised issues about the credibility of the complainant and the\n  procedures followed during the raid.\n    The court acknowledged that Raj Kumar had a criminal background but\n  concluded that this alone was not sufficient to discredit his\n  testimony.\n    There was a discrepancy regarding whether the bribe was for a certified\n  copy or a photocopy of the order, but the court found this not significant\n  enough to affect the case.\n    The court considered the potential typographical error in the Raid\n  Officer’s evidence but determined it did not undermine the case due to the\n  integrity of the evidence.\n    The scientific analysis confirmed that the hand and pocket washes tested\n  positive for phenolphthalein, indicating the presence of the tainted\n  money.\n    A rebuttable presumption of guilt was raised against Anand Prakash due to\n  the recovery of the bribe money and positive test results.\n    The court reduced the substantive sentence to six months for the offense\n  under Section 7 and one year for the offense under Section 13(2) of the\n  Act.\n    Yes, Anand Prakash was directed to surrender forthwith to serve the\n  modified sentence.\n    The court emphasized the need for greater sensitivity in recording evidence\n  to avoid inadvertent lapses and directed the District and Sessions Judge-I,\n  Delhi, to impress this upon Additional District and Sessions Judges.\n    The court did not find the application’s irregularities significant enough\n  to affect the outcome, noting the application was recovered from Anand\n  Prakash’s office table.\n    The court found the presence of shadow witnesses acceptable and noted that\n  their testimonies were not undermined by their association with the\n  police.\n    The court acknowledged some procedural issues but found the evidence\n  sufficient to uphold the conviction.\n    The appeal was partially allowed, and the substantive sentence was reduced,\n  but the conviction was upheld.\n    The CFSL report provided crucial evidence by confirming the presence of\n  phenolphthalein in the hand and pocket washes, supporting the prosecution’s\n  case.\n    The court emphasized that independent verification was important but did\n  not find it essential in this case given the overall evidence.\n    The court addressed procedural errors by emphasizing the importance of\n  proper evidence handling and adherence to legal protocols.\n    Discrepancies in evidence were noted but did not substantially impact the\n  overall verdict due to the corroborative nature of other evidence.\n    Anand Prakash did not provide any witnesses in his defense.\n    The prosecution argued that the procedural handling of evidence was appropriate\n  and adhered to legal standards.\n    The court interpreted the accused’s actions as consistent with the charges,\n  supported by the evidence and testimonies.\n    The appellate court reduced the substantive sentence but upheld the\n  conviction.\n    The case is significant for its clarifications on procedural handling of\n  evidence and the standards for corruption convictions.",

The\n  primary issue was whether the approval of the draft schemes for\n  nationalization of certain routes by the APSRTC was valid given the\n  allegations of corruption and bias against the Transport Minister.\n    The draft schemes proposed by APSRTC in 1977 aimed to nationalize certain\n  routes in a district, allowing APSRTC buses to operate exclusively on those\n  routes.\n    The private operators objected to the schemes on grounds including the\n  alleged corruption and the unfairness of the proposed nationalization.\n    The change in government led to delays and multiple re-evaluations of the\n  schemes, with different approvals given under varying circumstances.\n    Allegations were made that the Transport Minister received illegal\n  gratification from some operators to defer the schemes.\n    The High Court initially quashed the approval of the schemes, directing\n  that the objections be heard afresh and considering changes in\n  circumstances.\n    The High Court dismissed some writ petitions on grounds of petitioners not\n  approaching with clean hands and allowed others, directing the State to\n  reconsider the schemes.\n    The appellants argued that the allegations against the Transport Minister\n  were vague, and the schemes were approved following proper procedures.\n    The Supreme Court found that there was insufficient material to\n  substantiate the allegations of bias against the Transport Minister.\n    The Court considered the delay between 1977 and 1983 as not unreasonable\n  given the circumstances, and the delay from 1983 to 1985 as acceptable.\n    The Supreme Court allowed the continuation of the schemes' implementation,\n  emphasizing the need to avoid chaos from altering long-established\n  schemes.\n    The State Government's position was that the delay and management issues\n  were addressed and that the schemes were justified despite the\n  criticisms.\n    The interim orders allowed the schemes to be implemented, maintaining\n  stability until the appeals were resolved.\n    The Supreme Court ruled to allow the appeals and restore the approval of\n  the schemes, rejecting the High Court's conclusions of bias.\n    The Court considered the lack of substantial evidence of bias, the\n  practical effects of disrupting the schemes, and the procedural correctness\n  of the approvals.\n    The Court did not modify the interim orders to avoid disrupting the ongoing\n  implementation and causing potential chaos.\n    The Transport Minister’s role was central to the approval of the schemes,\n  though the Court found no evidence of bias in his actions.\n    The High Court's conclusion on bias was based on allegations without solid\n  evidence, which the Supreme Court found insufficient.\n    The delay in gazetting was deemed less significant as the approval had been\n  ratified by subsequent governments.\n    The Supreme Court’s ruling aimed to ensure the stability of the schemes\n  that had been in operation for years, preventing disruption.\n    Respondents contended that APSRTC was not fit to operate the routes due to\n  management and financial issues, which were considered but not upheld.\n    The Supreme Court found that the allegations of corruption were not\n  substantiated and did not affect the validity of the schemes’ approval.\n    Procedural issues included the handling of objections, the approval\n  process, and the legitimacy of the delays and ministerial actions.\n    The Government orders issued post-approval were seen as validating the\n  schemes and addressing procedural and implementation aspects.\n    The judgment ensured that the schemes already in operation would continue,\n  maintaining the status quo until further proceedings.\n    Evidence presented included the timing of approvals, lack of substantial\n  proof of bias, and procedural adherence by the Transport Minister.\n    The Supreme Court viewed the new Government’s role as procedural, with no\n  impact on the validity of the previous approvals.\n    The procedural history involved multiple levels of appeals, writ petitions,\n  and interim orders before reaching the Supreme Court.\n    Legislative assembly questions were considered as part of the context but\n  did not substantiate the allegations of corruption on their own.\n    The Supreme Court’s decision upheld the implementation of the schemes,\n  focusing on practical outcomes and procedural correctness.",

The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. The\n  draft schemes proposed nationalization of certain transport routes, allowing\n  APSRTC buses to operate exclusively on those routes.\n    Private operators challenged the schemes by raising objections based on\n  corruption allegations and the fairness of the nationalization.\n    The High Court quashed the schemes due to procedural issues and the need to\n  reconsider the objections and changes in circumstances.\n    The change in government led to delays and re-evaluation of the schemes,\n  affecting the approval timeline and process.\n    Allegations included that the Transport Minister received bribes to defer\n  the schemes and later approved them contrary to promises.\n    The High Court’s order required a fresh hearing of objections and reassessment\n  of the schemes before finalizing them.\n    The Supreme Court found the High Court’s dismissal of some writ petitions\n  justified but challenged the quashing of schemes based on insufficient\n  evidence.\n    The appellants argued that allegations of bias were not substantiated and\n  that the schemes were approved following due process.\n    The Supreme Court concluded that the allegations of corruption against the\n  Transport Minister were unproven and did not affect the schemes'\n  validity.\n    The Court deemed the delay between the draft and final approval as not\n  significant enough to invalidate the schemes.\n    The Supreme Court allowed the schemes to continue operating to prevent\n  disruption, despite the appeals being pending.\n    Respondents questioned APSRTC’s capability to manage the routes due to\n  previous mismanagement and financial issues.\n    The interim orders maintained the schemes' status, preventing their\n  discontinuation while appeals were resolved.\n    The Supreme Court upheld the approval of the schemes, overruling the High\n  Court’s decision to quash them.\n    The Court found insufficient evidence of bias and corruption, leading to\n  the restoration of the schemes’ approval.\n    The Court opted to keep interim orders unchanged to avoid disrupting the\n  schemes’ ongoing implementation.\n    The Transport Minister’s involvement was scrutinized, but the Court found\n  no evidence of bias affecting the approval.\n    The High Court considered allegations of bias based on procedural\n  irregularities and potential ministerial influence.\n    The delay in gazetting was not considered a major factor by the Supreme\n  Court, as the schemes had been approved through proper channels.\n    The decision ensured that the schemes continued without interruption,\n  maintaining operational stability.\n    Respondents highlighted APSRTC’s operational inefficiencies and management\n  issues, which were addressed but not deemed valid for quashing the\n  schemes.\n    The Supreme Court found corruption allegations against the Transport\n  Minister unsubstantiated and did not affect the schemes’ legality.\n    Key procedural issues included the timing of approvals, adherence to legal\n  requirements, and handling of objections.\n    Government orders issued after the schemes’ approval were seen as\n  validating the process and addressing procedural aspects.\n    The judgment allowed the continued operation of the schemes, maintaining\n  the status quo.\n    The evidence reviewed included procedural timelines, approval\n  documentation, and claims of bias or corruption.\n    The new Government’s role was considered procedural, with no direct impact\n  on the schemes’ approval validity.\n    The appeals went through various stages, including High Court hearings and\n  interim orders, before reaching the Supreme Court.\n    Legislative scrutiny was part of the context but did not play a decisive\n  role in the Supreme Court’s judgment.\n    The Supreme Court’s decision reinforced the continuation of the schemes,\n  ensuring their stability and operational effectiveness.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. The\n  primary aim of the petitioners' sting operation was to expose Members of\n  Parliament accepting bribes to ask questions in Parliament.\n    The sting operation was aired on TV on December 12, 2005.\n    The Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha constituted committees to investigate the\n  allegations following the airing of the sting operation.\n    The FIR was registered approximately 18 months after the airing of the\n  sting operation.\n    The FIR was registered under Sections 12 and 13 of the Prevention of\n  Corruption Act.\n    The petitioners argued that they should not be charged but should be\n  considered witnesses as their actions were aimed at exposing\n  corruption.\n    The High Court initially dismissed the petitioners' plea to quash the FIR,\n  stating that investigation was necessary.\n    The Court directed the police to investigate the entire offence and not\n  just the middlemen and media persons involved, and to complete the\n  investigation within 60 days.\n    The petitioners argued that they should be considered witnesses because\n  they conducted the sting operation to expose corruption, not to commit a\n  crime.\n    The State counsel opposed the petitioners' argument and did not agree to\n  use them as witnesses, insisting they had committed an offence.\n    The Court highlighted the constitutional duties of citizens to cherish and\n  follow ideals of a corruption-free society, uphold sovereignty, and strive\n  towards excellence.\n    The Court viewed the petitioners as having acted in the public interest by\n  exposing corruption, rather than as criminals.\n    The Court compared the current case with past cases where complainants or\n  whistleblowers were not considered accomplices.\n    The Court believed it was unjust to charge the petitioners because their\n  actions were intended to expose corruption, not to commit a crime.\n    The Court indicated that independent witnesses are not always necessary in\n  corruption cases due to the secretive nature of such crimes.\n    The State counsel argued that the petitioners should have reported to the\n  CBI, whereas the Court found their actions were justified.\n    The Court noted a significant erosion of values in public life and\n  corruption becoming commonplace, citing past judicial observations.\n    The Court supported the use of agent provocateurs as a means to expose\n  high-level corruption.\n    The Court justified quashing the charge-sheet and summons based on the\n  petitioners' intent and the public interest served by their actions.\n    The Court suggested that charging the petitioners might discourage future\n  whistleblowers and undermine efforts to expose corruption.",

A.\n  Krishnamurthy were also accused.\n    Vardhan argued that proceeding with the departmental inquiry would\n  prejudice his defense in the criminal case.\n    The departmental proceedings were based on allegations of bribery and were\n  supported by telephone tapping evidence.\n    The independent witnesses were not named specifically but were present\n  during the alleged bribe transaction.\n    The Supreme Court has held that criminal and departmental proceedings can\n  run concurrently.\n    The Tribunal referenced the case of State of Rajasthan v. B.K. Meena.\n    The counsel claimed that the CBI had not yet filed a chargesheet after\n  three years.\n    The Tribunal reasoned that there was no need to stay the proceedings as the\n  charges were grave but did not involve complex legal issues.\n    The Tribunal held that both proceedings could continue without interference\n  from one another.\n    A departmental enquiry aims to maintain service discipline, while criminal\n  prosecution addresses violations of law.\n    The Tribunal stated that staying proceedings is not automatic and must be\n  based on specific circumstances.\n    The Tribunal cited cases like Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v.\n  Sarvesh Berry and State Bank of India v. R.B. Sharma.\n    The Tribunal decided not to stay the departmental proceedings.\n    The case addressed the lack of a rigid formula for staying departmental\n  proceedings.\n    The Supreme Court emphasized that each case should be considered based on\n  its own facts and circumstances.\n    Sh. A. Krishnamurthy was alleged to have facilitated the bribery\n  arrangement.\n    The case involved evidence from telephone taps showing communication\n  related to the bribery.\n    M. Paul Anthony established that criminal and departmental proceedings can\n  proceed simultaneously.\n    The Tribunal noted that staying proceedings is considered in cases\n  involving serious and complex charges.\n    The Supreme Court stated that delays in criminal trials cannot automatically\n  result in staying departmental proceedings.\n    The original application was dismissed, and no stay was granted.\n    The rationale was that the charges were serious but did not warrant an\n  automatic stay of proceedings.\n    The departmental proceedings were allowed to continue as they were deemed\n  not to prejudice the criminal case.\n    The key takeaway is that criminal and departmental proceedings can proceed\n  simultaneously, and each case must be evaluated on its specific facts.",

The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13.

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30.

The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations.

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. The\n  main issue was whether the dismissal of Aslam Khan Mehboob Khan Pathan was\n  justified and if the lower courts' decisions to overturn this dismissal were\n  correct.\n    The parties involved were the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation\n  (petitioner) and The General Secretary of BEST Workers Union, along with\n  Aslam Khan Mehboob Khan Pathan (respondents).\n    Pathan was accused of accepting a bribe to facilitate the selection of a\n  candidate for a job.\n    The Labour Court ruled in favor of Pathan on 16 March 1996.\n    The Labour Court’s decision resulted in Pathan’s reinstatement with\n  continuity of service and back wages.\n    The Industrial Court dismissed the appeal filed by the Brihanmumbai\n  Municipal Corporation, upholding the Labour Court’s decision.\n    The complaint alleged that Pathan demanded and received a bribe from Gawade\n  to influence his job selection process.\n    The challenge was based on the evidence including a joint site inspection\n  that questioned the occurrence of the bribery incident.\n    The Labour Court found that the evidence was doubtful due to discrepancies\n  such as the hotel owner’s statement about the hotel being closed.\n    The hotel owner’s statement about the closure of his hotel cast doubt on\n  the bribery incident, leading to the Labour Court’s decision.\n    The petitioner argued that the Labour Court erred in considering the Note\n  made by the Trying Officer and that the evidence was insufficient to overturn\n  the dismissal.\n    The High Court dismissed the writ petition, agreeing with the decisions of\n  the Labour and Industrial Courts.\n    The primary contention was that the Labour Court had incorrectly overturned\n  the dismissal order based on inadequate evidence.\n    The Labour Court’s findings were seen as a proper evaluation of the\n  evidence, leading to the reversal of the dismissal order.\n    The Industrial Court found that the Labour Court had appropriately\n  considered the evidence and refused to interfere with its decision.\n    The case referenced statutory provisions related to the validity of\n  evidence and procedural fairness in domestic enquiries.\n    The learned judge in the Labour Court was noted for evaluating the evidence\n  and making findings based on the available records.\n    The Labour Court considered the evidence provided during the enquiry but\n  found it inadequate to support the dismissal.\n    The High Court found no merit in the petitioner's arguments and upheld the\n  lower courts' decisions.\n    The case of State of Haryana v/s Ratan Singh was cited to support the\n  argument that the sufficiency of evidence in domestic enquiries is beyond\n  judicial scrutiny.\n    The joint site inspection questioned the accuracy of the bribery claims and\n  contributed to the Labour Court’s findings.\n    The Note by the Trying Officer was significant as it provided evidence\n  regarding the hotel’s closure, affecting the case's credibility.\n    Arguments were made about the adequacy and reliability of the evidence,\n  including contradictions and discrepancies noted by the courts.\n    The High Court justified its decision by affirming the lower courts'\n  findings and upholding their decisions.\n    Legal principles of procedural fairness and evidence sufficiency were applied\n  in reviewing the Labour Court's decision.\n    The BEST Workers Union was involved in representing Pathan and challenging\n  the dismissal through appeals and applications.\n    The Labour Court’s decision to reinstate Pathan was based on its assessment\n  of the evidence and procedural fairness.\n    The High Court found that the evidence was not sufficient to warrant\n  interference with the Labour Court’s decision.\n    Procedural aspects included the evaluation of evidence and adherence to\n  statutory requirements for conducting domestic enquiries.\n    The High Court instructed that the writ petition be dismissed, thereby\n  upholding the decisions of the lower courts.",

The\n  petitioner is the State - A.C.B., represented by the Inspector of Police,\n  Anti-Corruption Bureau, Rajahmundry Range, Kakinada. The first respondent is\n  P. Seshagiri Rao. The first respondent alleged that the second respondent,\n  the Commissioner of Pithapuram Municipality, demanded a bribe of Rs. 1,000/-\n  to sanction a loan from his P.F. account.

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. The\n  primary issue was whether the Chief Judicial Magistrate erred in rejecting\n  the discharge applications on the grounds that prior sanction from the State\n  Government was required for prosecution.\n    The petitioners filed their discharge applications on the grounds that they\n  were public servants, and therefore, prosecution required prior sanction\n  under Section 197 CrPC.\n    The petitioners were charged under Sections 468 (forgery), 471 (using\n  forged documents), and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.\n    The petitioners were represented by Shri A.C. Dharmadhikari and Shri S.A.\n  Gordey.\n    The total amount alleged to have been embezzled was Rs. 1,65,334/-.\n    The order that was challenged was passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate.\n    Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure pertains to the prosecution\n  of judges and public servants.\n    It requires prior sanction from the State Government for prosecuting public\n  servants who are not removable from their office without such sanction.\n    Yes, the petitioners argued that their acts were connected to their\n  official duties and thus required prior sanction.\n    The Chief Judicial Magistrate was responsible for deciding on the discharge\n  applications of the petitioners.\n    The discharge applications were rejected by the Chief Judicial\n  Magistrate.\n    The State's counsel argued that the offenses committed were not connected\n  to the official duties of the petitioners and thus did not require prior\n  sanction.\n    The petitioners claimed that because they were public servants, their\n  prosecution required prior sanction under Section 197 CrPC.\n    The Apex Court stated that sanction under Section 197 is necessary if the\n  act complained of is inseparable from the discharge of official duties.\n    The Apex Court stated that the acts must be so integrally connected with\n  official duties that they cannot be separated to require sanction.\n    The necessity of sanction under Section 197 was discussed in the case of\n  P.K. Pradhan v. State of Sikkim.\n    The final decision was to leave the question of sanction open and direct\n  the Chief Judicial Magistrate to decide the criminal case according to\n  law.\n    The court found that the connection between the petitioners' acts and their\n  official duties could not be determined definitively at that stage.\n    The court directed the Chief Judicial Magistrate to decide the criminal\n  case according to law within three months from the receipt of the judgment.\n    The official status of a public servant influences whether prior sanction\n  is needed, depending on whether the acts were performed in discharge of\n  official duties.\n    A total of four criminal applications were discussed in the case.\n    Uttam s/o Hiraman Ingle was associated with the State Employees Insurance\n  Scheme.\n    The documents involved were medical reimbursement bills alleged to be\n  forged.\n    The court could not determine if the acts were inseparable from the\n  petitioners' duties without further evidence.\n    “Dereliction of duty” implies that the acts were committed in violation of\n  or not in line with official duties.\n    The Additional Public Prosecutor argued that the offenses were committed\n  independently of the petitioners' official duties and did not require\n  sanction.\n    The court found that there was insufficient material on record regarding\n  the petitioners' employment status and whether they could be removed without\n  sanction.\n    No, the service record of the petitioners was not produced in court.\n    The court proposed to leave the question of sanction to be decided during\n  the trial based on the evidence presented.\n    The court concluded that the discharge applications should be disposed of\n  by allowing the prosecution to establish its case and the defense to prove\n  the acts were in discharge of official duties.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30.

It provides an independent assessment of the case and helps ensure fairness.The CVC is required to be consulted before passing the final order in disciplinary proceedings involving corruption charges.The relevant rules and regulations are the ICAR Rules, which mandate consultation with the CVC and require the disciplinary authority to supply a copy of the CVC advice to the respondent.The High Court's decision reinstates the respondent in service, but requires him to face fresh disciplinary proceedings after receiving the CVC advice.This case emphasizes the importance of following proper procedures and providing due process in disciplinary proceedings, particularly in cases involving corruption charges. It highlights the significance of the CVC's role and the requirement for transparency in the disciplinary process.",

The applicant was challenging the order of the Special Judge rejecting his application for discharge in Special Case No.2/1996.\n\nThe applicant argued that the Rs. 400/- bribe amount found on his table was planted and was never actually demanded, claiming the charges were thus groundless.\n\nThe prosecution countered by presenting evidence that included the recovery of the bribe amount from the applicant’s table, arguing that this evidence supported the charge and was not groundless.\n\nThe post-trap panchanama recorded the recovery of the bribe from the applicant’s house. The Section 164 statement, while noting that the money was placed on the table by the complainant, did not invalidate the charges, showing that evidence needed further examination.\n\nNilkanth Kute, the complainant, alleged that the applicant demanded a bribe to process a mutation entry in the Revenue records, leading to the trap and subsequent investigation.\n\nThe Special Judge found sufficient prima facie material to proceed with the charges based on the evidence provided, including the post-trap panchanama and the nature of the allegations.\n\nThe court concluded that the Special Judge was justified in rejecting the discharge application and dismissed the revision application, upholding the rule discharge.",

The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. The petitioner is facing charges under Sections 7, 13(1)(d), and 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1998, for alleged illegal gratification and corruption.\nThe petitioner argued that he is not a public servant under the Act and, therefore, cannot be prosecuted for the charges.\nThe petitioner claimed he could not be prosecuted because he was not a public servant as defined under the Act.\nThe court referred to Naresh Kumar Madan vs. State of Maharashtra, where the Supreme Court affirmed that employees of the Electricity Board are considered public servants.\nThe Supreme Court held that employees of statutory corporations like the Electricity Board are public servants and can be prosecuted under the Prevention of Corruption Act.\nThe Supreme Court’s decision invalidated the petitioner’s argument, as it clarified that such employees are indeed public servants.\nThe court dismissed the petition, affirming that the petitioner was correctly classified as a public servant and was rightly subject to prosecution.",

The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13.

The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. The petitioner seeks enforcement of a foreign arbitration award from 17th August 2007 against Korp Resources, arguing that no steps were taken to set aside the award, making it enforceable.\n\nThe arbitration award involves the decree-holder and Korp Resources, with the dispute also considering invoices raised on Korp Gems, a separate legal entity.\n\nThe decree-holder's counsel argues that the award against Korp Resources is valid and cannot be challenged at the enforcement stage since no application was filed to set it aside.\n\nThe judgment-debtor contends that the award should not be enforced against Korp Gems, as there is no arbitration agreement with them, and Korp Resources and Korp Gems are separate legal entities.\n\nThe court considers \"public policy\" under Section 48 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, finding no issues that would prevent enforcement and rejecting the judgment-debtor’s objections.\n\nThe court ruled that the award is enforceable against Korp Resources, rejecting the objections and ordering enforcement as requested by the petitioner.\n\nThe court appointed a Receiver to take possession of the assets as requested by the petitioner, with the Receiver required to report back to the court.\n\nThe case discussed Sections 44, 48, and 7 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, focusing on the concept of public policy.\n\nThe court rejected the objections because they had already been addressed by the arbitrator, and there was no evidence of fraud, corruption, or anything patently illegal.\n\nThe judgment affirms that an arbitration award, once not set aside, is enforceable, limiting the scope for challenging foreign arbitration awards under Indian law.",

The petitioner is the State - A.C.B., represented by the Inspector of Police, Anti-Corruption Bureau, Rajahmundry Range, Kakinada. The first respondent is P. Seshagiri Rao. The first respondent alleged that the second respondent, the Commissioner of Pithapuram Municipality, demanded a bribe of Rs. 1,000/- to sanction a loan from his P.F. account. After receiving the complaint, the Anti-Corruption Bureau registered a case in Crime No. 6/RC-RJY/99 under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and arranged a trap, catching the second respondent receiving the bribe. The first respondent approached the Magistrate on 30th October 1999 to record his statement under Section 164 of the Code. The petitioner's counsel argued that the Magistrate had no power to record the statement under Section 164 as it was un-sponsored by the Investigating Agency, making the recording illegal. The petitioner's counsel relied on the Supreme Court judgment in Jogendra Nahak & Others vs. State of Orissa & Others. The Supreme Court held that a Magistrate cannot record a statement under Section 164 unless sponsored by the Investigating Agency. The court concluded that the Magistrate erred in recording the statement under Section 164 and set it aside. The court quashed the proceedings and declared that the statement cannot remain on record. The court did not express any opinion on whether the second respondent could confront the first respondent with the statement during the trial, leaving the matter open.",

The discretion involves the authority to extend the period for availing traveling allowance, which must be used reasonably and not arbitrarily. The conditions include using the shortest route to the settlement place and applying within one year of retirement, with possible extensions in special cases. The petitioner requested an extension due to delays in provident fund settlement. The respondents stated that the delay in provident fund settlement was not a valid reason for extending the traveling allowance period. The petitioner argued that his provident fund amount and interest were incorrectly calculated, citing relevant provident fund rules. The law requires the Accounts Officer to ensure accurate payment and issue authorities for payments. The tribunal rejected the extension request, assuming the petitioner’s wife's employment was a factor without evidence. The court found this decision unsatisfactory, noting a lack of proper consideration and directed the respondents to reconsider the matter within two weeks.",

High Court of Delhi at New DelhiBail Application No. 102/2009, January 23, 2009Sanjeev MathurStateSections 7 and 13 of the Prevention of Corruption ActDecember 19, 2008Police Station Anti Corruption Branch, DelhiAjeet KumarThe petitioner demanded a bribe of Rs. 3000/- from the complainant for parking vehicles in a specific area.November 12, 2008The complainant provided a tape recording of the conversation where the petitioner demanded the bribe.The petitioner filed the anticipatory bail application on January 13, 2009.The petitioner's lawyer argued that there was no prima facie case against the petitioner and that he was likely to be harassed if arrested.The petitioner's lawyer relied on various judgments and precedents to support his arguments.The prosecution argued that the petitioner had received a bribe and that custodial interrogation was necessary.The prosecution relied on the tape-recorded conversation and the seriousness of the charges.The Additional Sessions Judge dismissed the bail application.The petitioner's lawyer argued that the Additional Sessions Judge had erred in dismissing the bail application and that the petitioner should be granted bail.The petitioner's lawyer relied on the same evidence and arguments presented before the Additional Sessions Judge.The prosecution argued that the Additional Sessions Judge's decision was correct and that the petitioner should not be granted bail.The prosecution relied on the same evidence and arguments presented before the Additional Sessions Judge.The High Court dismissed the bail application.The High Court found that the petitioner had received a bribe and that custodial interrogation was necessary to investigate the case further.The tape-recorded conversation is crucial evidence in the case as it directly implicates the petitioner in the act of bribery.The complainant's past criminal record is not directly relevant to the case, but it could potentially be used to argue that he may have fabricated the allegations against the petitioner.The High Court emphasized the need for custodial interrogation to effectively investigate the case and gather further evidence.The principles governing the grant of anticipatory bail in India are laid out in various Supreme Court judgments, such as Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia v. State of Punjab. These principles include the extraordinary nature of the power to grant anticipatory bail, the need for exceptional circumstances, and the consideration of factors such as the seriousness of the offense and the likelihood of the accused absconding.When deciding on a bail application, the court considers factors such as the seriousness of the offense, the likelihood of the accused absconding, the possibility of the accused tampering with evidence, the need for custodial interrogation, and the strength of the prosecution's case.The High Court's decision denies the petitioner anticipatory bail, meaning he could be arrested at any time.This case reinforces the principles governing the grant of anticipatory bail in India, particularly in cases involving serious offenses such as corruption. It highlights the importance of considering the specific circumstances of each case and the need for custodial interrogation in certain situations.",

State is defined in clauses (a) to (e) under Article 3 to include a Union\n  territory, but in the proviso, a State does not include a Union\n  territory.\n    \n    Explanation I of Article 3 states that in clauses (a) to (e),\n  \"State\" includes a Union territory, but in the proviso,\n  \"State\" does not include a Union territory.\n    \n    Clause (a) of Article 3 confers the power on Parliament to form a new State\n  or Union territory by uniting a part of any State or Union territory to any\n  other State or Union territory.\n    \n    Explanation II under Article 3 clarifies that the power to form a new State\n  or Union territory includes the power to unite a part of any State or Union\n  territory to another.\n    \n    Article 4 mentions that any law referred to in Article 2 or Article 3 must\n  contain provisions for amending the First Schedule to reflect the\n  changes.\n    \n    Laws made under Articles 2 and 3 can include provisions for amending the\n  First and Fourth Schedules, as well as supplemental, incidental, and\n  consequential provisions.\n    \n    To give effect to the provisions mentioned in Articles 2 and 3, the law must\n  include provisions for the amendment of the First Schedule and the Fourth\n  Schedule.\n    \n    Clause (2) of Article 4 states that laws made under Articles 2 and 3 shall\n  not be deemed amendments of the Constitution for the purposes of Article 368.\n    \n    Laws affecting representation in Parliament are handled by including\n  provisions in the law for representation in Parliament and in the Legislature\n  of the affected State(s), as mentioned in Article 4.\n    \n    Article 4 states that laws made under Articles 2 and 3 should provide for\n  the amendment of the First and Fourth Schedules.\n    \n    The President's role in relation to Bills concerning the alteration of\n  state boundaries includes referring the Bill to the State Legislature for its\n  views.\n    \n    The Indian Constitution addresses the union of territories from one State\n  to another under the powers conferred by Article 3(a).\n    \n    The schedules of the Indian Constitution mentioned in Article 4 are the\n  First and Fourth Schedules.\n    \n    The First Schedule of the Indian Constitution contains the list of States\n  and Union territories.\n    \n    The Fourth Schedule of the Indian Constitution can be amended by laws made\n  under Articles 2 and 3, as per Article 4.\n    \n    Supplemental, incidental, and consequential provisions mentioned in Article\n  4 are those that Parliament may deem necessary to implement the changes in\n  the law.\n    \n    Article 4 emphasizes that certain laws are not considered amendments of the\n  Constitution for the purposes of Article 368 to allow flexibility in the\n  reorganization of states without needing a constitutional amendment.\n    \n    Provisions for the representation of states affected by laws under Articles\n  2 and 3 must be included in the law itself, as specified in Article 4.\n    \n    The Constitution (Thirty-fifth Amendment) Act, 1974, is significant\n  regarding Article 2A because it introduced provisions related to the\n  association of Sikkim with the Union.\n    \n    The Constitution ensures that any new State or Union territory formed has\n  adequate representation by including provisions for representation in\n  Parliament and State Legislatures in the laws made under Articles 2 and\n  3.\n    \n    The Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1955, relates to the procedures for\n  altering the name of a State by modifying the proviso in Article 3 that\n  requires the President to refer the Bill to the State Legislature for its\n  views",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations.

Article\n  7 specifies that a person who migrated from India to Pakistan after March 1,\n  1947, shall not be deemed a citizen of India.\n    \n    A person who migrated to Pakistan after March 1, 1947, will be deemed a\n  citizen of India if they return to India under a resettlement or permanent\n  return permit issued by or under the authority of any law.\n    \n    A person who migrated to Pakistan must return to India under a resettlement\n  or permanent return permit to be considered for resettlement or permanent\n  return under Article 7.\n    \n    Article 7 states that a person returning to India under a resettlement or\n  permanent return permit will be deemed to have migrated to India after July\n  19, 1948.\n    \n    Article 8 states that any person who or whose ancestors were born in India\n  as defined in the Government of India Act, 1935, and who is ordinarily\n  residing outside India, shall be deemed a citizen of India if they have been\n  registered as a citizen by the diplomatic or consular representative of India\n  in their residing country.\n    \n    Diplomatic or consular representatives are responsible for registering\n  individuals as Indian citizens if they meet the conditions specified in\n  Article 8.\n    \n    To be registered as an Indian citizen while residing outside India, a\n  person must make an application to the diplomatic or consular representative\n  of India in the prescribed form and manner.\n    \n    Article 9 states that a person shall not be a citizen of India if they have\n  voluntarily acquired the citizenship of any foreign state.\n    \n    Article 10 specifies that every person deemed to be a citizen of India\n  under previous provisions shall continue to be a citizen of India, subject to\n  any laws made by Parliament.\n    \n    Article 11 grants Parliament the power to make provisions regarding the\n  acquisition and termination of citizenship.\n    \n    Article 7 differentiates by stating that those who migrated to Pakistan\n  before March 1, 1947, and have returned under the specified conditions are\n  deemed citizens, while those who migrated after this date are not considered\n  citizens unless they meet additional conditions.\n    \n    The proviso in Article 7 states that a person who migrated to Pakistan but\n  later returned to India under a resettlement or permanent return permit will\n  be deemed to have migrated to India after July 19, 1948.\n    \n    Article 8 addresses individuals whose ancestors were born in India by\n  allowing them to be deemed Indian citizens if they are registered by a\n  diplomatic or consular representative while residing outside India.\n    \n    A person residing abroad must apply to a diplomatic or consular\n  representative of India in the prescribed form and manner to be registered as\n  an Indian citizen under Article 8.\n    \n    According to Article 9, a person cannot be a citizen of India if they have\n  voluntarily acquired the citizenship of another country.\n    \n    Article 10 implies that individuals who are deemed citizens of India under\n  previous provisions will continue to be citizens, subject to any laws\n  Parliament may enact.\n    \n    Article 11 allows Parliament to make laws concerning the acquisition and\n  termination of citizenship, indicating that Parliament has the authority to\n  set rules regarding these matters.\n    \n    Article 7 impacts the citizenship status of individuals who have migrated\n  from Pakistan by specifying that those who returned to India under the\n  specified conditions are treated as having migrated after July 19, 1948,\n  affecting their citizenship status.\n    \n    The \"nineteenth day of July, 1948,\" is significant because it is\n  the cutoff date for determining the status of individuals who migrated from\n  Pakistan and later returned to India. Migration before this date affects\n  citizenship differently than migration after this date.\n    \n    The Government of India Act, 1935, is used to define India and its\n  territories for citizenship purposes under Article 8.\n    \n    The Government of the Dominion of India or the Government of India\n  prescribes the form and manner of applications for citizenship by diplomatic\n  or consular representatives under Article 8.\n    \n    To be registered as an Indian citizen by a diplomatic or consular\n  representative, a person must apply in the form and manner prescribed by the\n  Government of India.\n    \n    Acquiring foreign citizenship affects one’s status as an Indian citizen\n  under Article 9, leading to the loss of Indian citizenship.\n    \n    Article 11 allows Parliament to make any provisions regarding the\n  acquisition and termination of citizenship, which may include changes to\n  existing laws or new legislation.\n    \n    A person can be considered to have migrated to India after July 19, 1948,\n  if they return under a resettlement or permanent return permit after\n  migrating to Pakistan.\n    \n    If a person acquires the citizenship of another country, according to\n  Article 9, they lose their status as an Indian citizen.\n    \n    Article 11 affects citizenship by granting Parliament the authority to\n  create and modify laws related to citizenship acquisition and\n  termination.\n    \n    A person residing abroad can be registered as an Indian citizen by applying\n  to a diplomatic or consular representative of India under Article 8.\n    \n    Article 10 states that the continuity of citizenship is maintained for\n  individuals deemed citizens under previous provisions, subject to parliamentary\n  laws.\n    \n    Article 7 addresses migration and resettlement by specifying that\n  individuals who migrated from Pakistan and returned under certain conditions\n  will be treated as having migrated to India after July 19, 1948.",

Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts.

P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18.

The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21.

The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30.

P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18.

The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30.

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30.

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. Article\n  21A mandates that the State shall provide free and compulsory education to\n  all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the State\n  may, by law, determine.\n    \n    Article 22(1) states that no person who is arrested shall be detained in\n  custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such\n  arrest. The person must also be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal\n  practitioner of their choice.\n    \n    Article 22(2) requires that every person who is arrested and detained in\n  custody must be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of\n  twenty-four hours of such arrest, excluding the time necessary for the\n  journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate.\n    \n    The exceptions to the rights provided in Article 22(1) and (2) are:\n    \n    (a) Any person who is an enemy alien.\n    (b) Any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for\n  preventive detention.\n    Article 22(4) states that no law providing for preventive detention shall\n  authorize the detention of a person for longer than three months\n  unless:\n    \n    (a) An Advisory Board, consisting of persons who are or have been qualified\n  to be appointed as High Court judges, has reviewed the detention and approved\n  it.\n    The Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978 proposed substituting\n  Article 22(4) to limit preventive detention to a maximum of two months unless\n  an Advisory Board, constituted as per recommendations of the Chief Justice of\n  the appropriate High Court, approves a longer period.\n    \n    The Advisory Board mentioned in Article 22(4) reviews the cases of\n  individuals detained under preventive detention laws to ensure their\n  detention is justified and within the bounds of the law.\n    \n    The Constitution ensures protection for arrested individuals by\n  guaranteeing they are informed of the grounds for their arrest and have the\n  right to legal representation.\n    \n    Article 22(1) guarantees that individuals who are arrested will be informed\n  of the grounds for their arrest and have the right to consult and be defended\n  by a legal practitioner of their choice.\n    \n    Article 22(4) outlines that the conditions for detaining a person beyond\n  the prescribed period under preventive detention laws include the review and\n  approval by an Advisory Board.\n    \n    Article 21A states that the State is responsible for providing free and\n  compulsory education to all children between the ages of six and\n  fourteen.\n    \n    The provisions of Article 22(1) and (2) can be overridden in cases\n  involving enemy aliens or individuals detained under laws for preventive\n  detention.\n    \n    The term \"enemy alien\" refers to individuals who are not citizens\n  of India and are considered to be in a hostile relationship with the country,\n  which affects their rights under Article 22.\n    \n    The Constitution addresses preventive detention by allowing laws for such\n  detention but requires an Advisory Board to review extended detentions to\n  prevent abuse.\n    \n    The Chief Justice’s role in preventive detention, as per the proposed\n  amendment, involves recommending the formation of the Advisory Board that\n  reviews detention cases.\n    \n    The Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2002, which adds Article\n  21A, is not yet in force and the date for its implementation is to be\n  notified later.\n    \n    Article 22 differentiates general arrest and preventive detention by\n  providing specific procedural safeguards for arrests and requiring a review\n  process for preventive detention.\n    \n    The procedural safeguards under Article 22 include informing the arrested\n  person of the grounds for their arrest, allowing legal representation, and\n  producing the detainee before a magistrate within twenty-four hours.\n    \n    Article 21A places the responsibility on the State to ensure that all\n  children aged six to fourteen receive free and compulsory education.\n    \n    Article 22(4) seeks to balance individual rights with state security by\n  allowing preventive detention but requiring periodic reviews to prevent\n  indefinite detention.\n    \n    Legal recourse for someone detained beyond legal limits includes\n  challenging the detention through the courts, arguing that the detention is\n  not in accordance with Article 22’s provisions.\n    \n    Article 22 ensures access to legal representation by stating that arrested\n  individuals have the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner\n  of their choice.\n    \n    The Advisory Board is constituted with persons who are or have been\n  qualified to be appointed as High Court judges or are eligible for such\n  appointments.\n    \n    Article 22 is part of the Fundamental Rights under the Constitution, which\n  are designed to protect individual liberties and ensure fair treatment under\n  the law.\n    \n    The Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, impacts preventive\n  detention by shortening the maximum detention period and improving safeguards\n  for detained individuals.\n    \n    Article 22 handles the rights of enemy aliens by limiting the protections\n  available to them compared to Indian citizens, particularly regarding arrest\n  and detention.\n    \n    The Constitution limits preventive detention laws by requiring periodic\n  reviews and setting a maximum detention period, subject to the Advisory\n  Board’s approval.\n    \n    Provisions of Article 22 might be challenged in court on grounds of\n  violation of procedural safeguards or if the detention is found to be\n  unjustified.\n    \n    Review provisions for preventive detention cases include the role of the\n  Advisory Board in assessing the legality and necessity of continued\n  detention.\n    \n    The Constitution ensures detainees are not held indefinitely by requiring\n  periodic review and setting a maximum detention period, with provisions for\n  legal recourse.",

The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts.

The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13.

D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21.

The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations.

Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30.

The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30.

Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30.

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations.

Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30.

Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30.

The\n  President can notify a joint sitting of both Houses if a Bill is not passed\n  by the other House, if the Houses have disagreed on amendments, or if more\n  than six months have elapsed since the Bill was received by the other House\n  without being passed, unless the Bill has lapsed due to a dissolution of the\n  House of the People.\n    \n    The conditions that must be met are: the Bill has not been passed by the\n  other House, the Houses have disagreed on amendments, or six months have\n  passed without the Bill being passed by the other House.\n    \n    The six-month period is calculated excluding any time during which the\n  House is prorogued or adjourned for more than four consecutive days.\n    \n    If the President notifies the intention of a joint sitting, neither House\n  shall proceed further with the Bill until the joint sitting is held.\n    \n    Yes, the President can summon the Houses to a joint sitting even after the\n  initial notification.\n    \n    The Bill must be passed by a majority of the total number of members of\n  both Houses present and voting at the joint sitting.\n    \n    No, Money Bills are not subject to the joint sitting procedure.\n    \n    If a Bill is not passed with amendments by the other House and is returned\n  to the originating House, no amendments are considered at the joint\n  sitting.\n    \n    The President's role is to notify the intention of a joint sitting, summon\n  the Houses to meet, and facilitate the process.\n    \n    Periods during prorogation or adjournment for more than four consecutive\n  days are not included in the six-month calculation.\n    \n    The President’s notification halts further progress on the Bill in both\n  Houses until the joint sitting is convened.\n    \n    A \"majority of the total number of members\" means more than half\n  of the members of both Houses who are present and voting.\n    \n    Before summoning a joint sitting, the President must notify the intention,\n  and then call the Houses to meet if necessary.\n    \n    The joint sitting is significant as it provides a mechanism to resolve\n  disagreements and ensure the passage of the Bill.\n    \n    If one House disagrees, the joint sitting is used to resolve the\n  disagreement and pass the Bill with or without amendments.\n    \n    If the Bill is passed with amendments during the joint sitting, it is\n  deemed passed by both Houses for constitutional purposes.\n    \n    No, a Bill that has lapsed due to dissolution cannot be considered in the\n  joint sitting process.\n    \n    The joint sitting allows for the resolution of legislative deadlocks\n  between the two Houses.\n    \n    The joint sitting procedure is limited to Bills that have not been passed\n  by both Houses or where there is disagreement on amendments.\n    \n    The Bill is decided upon by the majority vote of the members present and\n  voting at the joint sitting.\n    \n    If the Bill does not reach the joint sitting within the stipulated time,\n  the President may still notify a joint sitting if necessary.\n    \n    No, certain Bills, like Money Bills, are exempt from the joint sitting\n  process.\n    \n    The joint sitting ensures the Bill's passage by allowing both Houses to\n  deliberate and vote together on the Bill.\n    \n    The President resolves disagreements by summoning the Houses for a joint\n  sitting to reach a decision on the Bill.\n    \n    Money Bills and other specific Bills may be excluded from the joint sitting\n  process as per constitutional provisions.\n    \n    The Constitution defines the joint sitting procedure including the\n  conditions under which it can be summoned and conducted.\n    \n    The majority voting requirement ensures that the Bill is passed by a broad\n  consensus of both Houses.\n    \n    Decisions during the joint sitting are made by the majority of members\n  present and voting.\n    \n    If the President’s notification does not result in a joint sitting, the\n  Bill's status remains pending as per the constitutional provisions.\n    \n    The joint sitting addresses legislative stalemates by providing a mechanism\n  for both Houses to collectively resolve disagreements on Bills.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30.

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations.

The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts.

The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12.

The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30.

The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28.

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. The main issue was the long delay in investigation and trial, affecting their right to a speedy trial.The ACB conducted the investigation and filed the charge-sheet against the appellants.The primary argument was that the delay in the investigation violated their right to a speedy trial under Article 21.The High Court dismissed the petition based on a previous similar case decision.Article 21 ensures the right to life and personal liberty, including the right to a speedy trial.The ACB's investigation took four years.The Supreme Court quashed the prosecution against the two lady appellants due to insufficient evidence and their old age.The prosecution was quashed because there was insufficient evidence and the ladies were elderly.The case was not quashed against the public servant and his wife due to sufficient evidence and the gravity of charges.The appellants raised concerns about mental trauma, financial loss, and social stigma due to the delay.The delay in criminal proceedings can violate the constitutional right to a speedy trial.The court viewed the delay as unfortunate but not sufficient to quash the case against the public servant.The case involved the Prevention of Corruption Act, specifically Section 13(2) and Section 13(1)(e).The court differentiated based on the lack of evidence against the ladies and their age.The court considered the possibility that the elderly appellants might not survive the long trial.The decision reflects a balance between justice and fairness, especially considering the age of the appellants.The Constitution Bench in A.R. Antulay vs. R.S. Nayak emphasized the importance of a speedy trial.The court refused to remand to avoid further delay.The public servant’s appeal was dismissed; he would face trial.The court acknowledged the delay but did not find it sufficient to dismiss the case against the public servant.The Rajdeo Sharma case highlighted the need for expeditious trials.The court found insufficient evidence to proceed against the elderly ladies.The two-year delay in obtaining sanction was noted but not deemed unreasonable.The court found that the ACB's investigation was thorough but time-consuming.The delay caused significant stress, financial loss, and stigma to the appellants.The quashing was justified due to the unlikelihood of conviction and the appellants' old age.The court doubted that the trial would result in conviction for the elderly ladies.The court balanced justice with the rights of the elderly accused by quashing their prosecution.The case illustrates systemic delays in the legal system and their impact on the accused.The court’s approach shows a compassionate consideration of the challenges faced by elderly accused persons.",

The petition was a public interest litigation filed under Article 32.The respondent was the incumbent Chief Minister of Sikkim.Allegations were made of amassing assets disproportionate to known income and misappropriating public money.The petitioners sought a writ of mandamus directing the CBI to investigate the allegations.Sikkim became a state of India in 1975.Article 371F provides special provisions for Sikkim.The Income Tax Act has not been enforced in Sikkim.The respondent is the founder of the Sikkim Democratic Front.The respondent has served as Chief Minister since 1994.The declared asset amount was Rs. 4,76,54,238/- in 2004.The alleged actual asset amount is more than Rs. 25 crores.Annexure P-1 refers to a list of the respondent's family members.The alleged misappropriated amount is Rs. 15.38 crores.Annexure P-20 contains allegations of misappropriation by the Sikkim Power Development Corporation.Sh. Vinod Bobde represented the petitioners.Sh. Ram Jethmalani made oral submissions for the respondents.Sh. Vinod Bobde made submissions in rejoinder.The petitioners were affiliated with a political party in Sikkim.Petitioner No. 3 affirmed that they were advised to file the petition by a former Chief Minister.Petitioner No. 3 sought to withdraw due to doubts about the motives of the lead petitioner.The apprehension was that the petition was motivated by political rivalry.Writ jurisdiction under Article 32 is for enforcing fundamental rights.The Court observed that even if the locus standi was accepted, the Court was not the appropriate forum.The Court found no merit in the argument that the alleged acts violated Article 14.The alleged acts could fall under offences in the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.Investigating agencies like the CBI or State Police are responsible for such investigations.Writ courts can only play a corrective role in criminal investigations.The Court stated that the Supreme Court should not direct the initiation of investigations.The Court advised petitioners to exhaust statutory remedies before approaching writ courts.The writ petition was dismissed with no order as to costs.",

  "output 6:1. The main charge against the accused was receiving a bribe of Rs. 100/- for issuing a copy of the 10(1) Adangal.  2. The judgment was delivered by the Honourable Sri Justice K.C. Bhanu.  3. The Criminal Appeal number was 957 of 1996.  4. The judgment was delivered on January 10, 2003.  5. The appellants were Buddha Mahalakshmi Naidu (who had died) and another individual.  6. The State of Andhra Pradesh was represented by the Public Prosecutor.  7. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, with default imprisonment of three months for both counts. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  8. The bribe amount involved was Rs. 100/-.  9. P.W.1 reported the bribe demand by filing a written complaint to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti Corruption Bureau.  10. The evidence included the tainted Rs. 100/- note, which was tested with phenolphthalein powder and found in the accused’s possession, and the testimony of P.W.1 who handed over the note.  11. The accused claimed that the Rs. 100/- note was part of a payment towards land revenue, not as a bribe.  12. The chemical test revealed that the phenolphthalein powder had reacted with the sodium carbonate solution, indicating that the Rs. 100/- note was indeed handled by the accused.  13. The key argument made by the defense was that the amount was part of the land revenue payment, not a bribe.  14. The prosecution's argument was that the amount was received as a bribe for issuing the Adangal copy, and not for land revenue.  15. The trial court found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  16. The defense's claim that P.W.1 did not explain his stay during the trap was not deemed significant enough to discredit P.W.1’s testimony.  17. The argument that the accused was not competent to issue the Adangal copy was dismissed, as the accused was the custodian of revenue records.  18. D.W.1’s testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies with the issuance of receipts for partial payments.  19. The evidence of D.W.2, the accused’s son, was considered hearsay and lacked credibility.  20. D.W.3’s testimony was not reliable due to the lack of specific details and corroboration.  21. The explanation given by the accused for having the Rs. 100/- note was considered an afterthought and not credible.  22. The accused’s fear and perplexity when confronted were interpreted as signs of guilt.  23. The appeal was dismissed due to lack of grounds to interfere with the trial court’s judgment.  24. The issue of valid sanction for prosecution was deemed irrelevant due to procedural issues being insufficient to cause a failure of justice.  25. The argument that the bribe amount was trivial and should not have led to criminal charges was rejected.  26. The decision in Bhagwan Jathya Bhoir’s case was not applicable due to differences in context and legal standards.  27. The court upheld the trial court's decision, concluding that the accused received the bribe and that the prosecution’s case was solid.  28. The appeal's dismissal affirmed the trial court’s findings and sentencing.  29. The accused’s claim of having received the amount as part of land revenue payment was not substantiated.  30. The judgment was based on the credibility of witnesses, evidence of the bribe, and procedural considerations. The main legal issue in this case is whether the High Court of Kerala erred in granting post-arrest bail to the accused respondents without adhering to the strict requirements of Section 37(1)(b)(ii) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.In Crime No. 14/2018, the accused respondents were charged with being in joint possession of 10.202 kgs of hashish oil and currency notes worth Rs. 13,50,000/-. They were accused of committing offenses punishable under Sections 20(b)(ii)(c) and 29 of the NDPS Act.The prosecution challenged the High Court's order because it believed that the High Court had granted bail without properly considering the mandatory requirements of Section 37 of the NDPS Act, which imposes strict conditions for granting bail in cases involving commercial quantities of narcotic drugs.Under Section 37 of the NDPS Act, bail can only be granted if the court is satisfied that:There are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offense.The accused is not likely to commit any offense while on bail.The Supreme Court held that the High Court failed to consider the mandatory provisions of Section 37 of the NDPS Act. The Supreme Court emphasized that the High Court should have recorded a finding that there were reasonable grounds to believe the accused was not guilty and was unlikely to commit an offense while on bail. Since the High Court did not satisfy these conditions, the Supreme Court found the grant of bail to be erroneous.The term \"reasonable grounds\" in Section 37 of the NDPS Act means something more substantial than mere prima facie grounds. It requires the existence of facts and circumstances that justify a strong belief that the accused is not guilty of the alleged offense.The Supreme Court found that the grant of bail to other accused persons in Crime No. 14/2018 did not absolve the accused respondent from the stringent conditions of Section 37 of the NDPS Act. The Court emphasized that each case must be considered on its own merits under the strict provisions of the NDPS Act.",

Tripathi was a clerk who allegedly received part of the bribe.The trap resulted in the recovery of tainted currency notes from the respondents.The trial judge acquitted the respondents on the grounds of improper sanction for prosecution.The High Court upheld the trial court's decision, citing non-application of mind in granting the sanction.The High Court found no evidence of a demand for illegal gratification by Harishankar.Ms. Vibha Datta Makhija represented the appellant in the Supreme Court.The appellant argued that the sanction order was valid and properly issued.Ms. Makhija cited the case \"State of Maharashtra vs. Ishwar Piraji Kalpatri\" as precedent.The Supreme Court held that personal scrutiny by the Sanctioning Authority was not legally required.The respondent claimed that the Rs. 200/- was given to him by Ghanshyamdas without his involvement in the crime.The Supreme Court disagreed with the lower courts' reasoning and found it flawed.The Court found that the recovery of Rs. 200/- was incriminating.The Supreme Court inferred a conspiracy between Ghanshyamdas and Harishankar.The Court confirmed that the sanction by the Principal Secretary was valid.The Supreme Court found the sanction order to be valid.The Supreme Court set aside the acquittal and allowed the appeal.The case was remitted to the Special Judge, Shahdol, for further orders.The Supreme Court criticized the lower courts for their handling of the sanction issue.The phenolphthalein powder was used to mark the currency notes for the trap.Shri R.N.
